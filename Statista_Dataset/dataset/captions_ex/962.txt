Since 1945 , the deadliest year for British Armed forces was 1951 , when there were 851 operational deaths . This was due to three separate conflicts : the Malayan Emergency , the 1951 Anglo-Egyptian War and the Korean War . Between 1959 and 2009 there were only three years that had more than 100 operational deaths : 1972 , 1973 and 1982 . The spike in deaths in the early 1970s were the result of the political violence in Northern Ireland at the time , and 237 of the 297 deaths in 1982 happened during the Falklands War . Over this 74-year period there have been a total of 7,187 British military deaths in conflicts .
