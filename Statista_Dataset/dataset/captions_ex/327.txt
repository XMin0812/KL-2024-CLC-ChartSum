The statistic depicts the market value of the largest internet companies worldwide as of June 2019 . That year , e-commerce company Amazon 's market value was 888 billion U.S. dollars . Alphabet , the parent company of search market leader Google , had a market value of 741 billion U.S. dollars . The end of the 1990 in the United States saw the rise of a great number of internet companies , also called online companies or a variety of the name `` dot com , '' where the `` .com '' domain is derived from the word commercial . At the time , such startups were merely riding the wave of early internet business , but had little capital and perhaps one good idea . Few companies have survived the burst of the dot com bubble and even fewer have managed to become internationally successful . A few notable exceptions are American companies such as Google ( founded in 1998 ) , Amazon ( founded in 1994 ) or eBay Inc. ( founded in 1995 ) , and the Chinese online giant Alibaba ( founded in 1998 ) , which have come to be some of the largest internet companies in the world . Topping the ranking of largest internet companies worldwide is currently Alphabet , the parent company of Google , with a market capitalization of 741 billion U.S. dollars as of June 2019 . Having started as a PhD project at Stanford University , the Google project slowly gained traction and is now the number one search engine in the world , with a market share of 90 percent on the search engine market . Due to a number of high profile acquisitions , Google has expanded its portfolio beyond search , to include the video content sharing site YouTube , the digital app platform Google Play Store , the webmail service Gmail and the web browser Google Chrome , to only name a few . As of March 2019 , it is also the most visited multi-platform website in the United States , with almost 256 million U.S. unique visitors during that month alone . In October 2015 , Google reorganized itself into a newly created parent company , the multinational conglomerate Alphabet Inc . The biggest internet companies in terms of their workforce are currently Amazon , Google and eBay .
