Timor-Leste followed with an index of 37.6 . The World Hunger Index combines three indicators : undernourishment , child underweight , and child mortality . There are approximately 516.5 million malnourished individuals living in the Asia and Pacific region and about 239 million malnourished living in Sub-Saharan Africa . Globally , there are 821.6 million people that are considered undernourished or starving . The term malnutrition includes both undernutrition and overnutrition . Undernutrition occurs when an individual can not maintain normal bodily functions such as growth , recovering from disease , and both learning and physical work . Some conditions such as diarrhea , malaria , HIV/AIDS are considered major causes of undernutrition . Rural and agricultural communities can be especially susceptible to hunger during certain seasons . The annual hunger gap occurs when a family 's food supply may run out before the next season 's harvest is available and can result in malnutrition . Nevertheless , the prevalence of people worldwide that are undernourished has decreased over the last decades , from 18.7 percent in 1990 - 92 to 10.8 percent in 2018 .
