In American Football terms , receiving yards refers to the number of yards gained by a receiver on a passing play – this not only includes the length of the pass , but also the additional yards that the player was able to run once he was in possession of the ball . Jerry Rice is the only player in NFL history with more than 20,000 receiving yards – the wide receiver racked up 22,895 receiving yards in a career spanning from 1985 to 2004 .
