During a survey in June 2019 , it was found that just 14 percent of U.S. adults visited a movie theater one or more times per month , but 46 percent stated that they went to the cinema to watch a movie once or year or less . Another survey earlier in the same year revealed that visits to the cinema can vary according to generation . On average , 34 percent of Gen Xers had seen one movie within the last month , compared to 43 percent of those classed as being members of Generation Z . Meanwhile , Boomers had seen far fewer movies recently than their younger counterparts .
