In 2015 , when Activision Blizzard last reported on World of Warcraft 's subscriptions , the game had 5.5 million global subscribers . It is projected that the numbers will gradually decrease to hit 4.46 million in 2023 . The game reached the peak of its popularity in the second half of 2010 , when Activision Blizzard 's estimates put the global number of WoW subscribers at 12 million . Before that , the number had been climbing steadily from 1.5 million in the first quarter of 2005 , before exceeding five million in the fourth quarter of 2006 and 10 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 . In 2011 , the figures started falling and , by the first quarter of 2014 , they decreased to the 2006 level . The predicted fall in numbers may be attributed to the fact that the game is now over 15 years old and that new online game modes , such as battle royale , have grown in popularity in recent years . The player count of Fortnite , for example , reached 350 million users worldwide in 2020 .
