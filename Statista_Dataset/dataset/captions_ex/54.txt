This statistic displays the annual exchange rate ( average or standardized measure ) of the euro to the U.S. dollar ( EUR USD ) according to the data from the European Central Bank and covers the period from the introduction of the euro in 1999 ( non-physical ) up until 2020 . The average ( standardized ) measure is based on the calculation of many observations throughout the period in question . It is therefore different than an annual measure at point in time , which reflects concrete values as of end of the year .
