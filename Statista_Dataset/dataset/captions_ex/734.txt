In December 2019 , Negin Mirsalehi had the most followers of all Dutch Instagram influencers . This according to data provided by InfluencerDB . The Iranian-Dutch fashion blogger fits in a larger trend : Dutch influencers either have a background in music ( such as rappers Lil ' Kleine and Boef ) , or they were involved in beauty or fashion . Examples of the latter category were bodybuilder and DJ Tavi Castro , Moroccan Dutch `` Mimi '' or Meryem van Os-Karin , Monica Geuze , `` Gio '' or Giovanni Latooy and television presenter Nicolette van Dam . FC Barcelona footballer Lieke Martens showed up as the only sports-related entry in the ranking . Instagram ranks among the most used apps in the Netherlands . A noticeable absentee from this list is Dutch makeup artist Nikki de Jager ( otherwise known as `` Nikkietutorials '' ) , who had over 12 million followers on Instagram . The source does not mention why she was excluded .
