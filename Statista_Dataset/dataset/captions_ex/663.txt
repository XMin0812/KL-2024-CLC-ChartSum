The homeownership rate in the United States amounted to 65.1 percent in 2019 . The homeownership rate is the proportion of occupied households which are occupied by the owners . This reached its peak in 2004 before the 2007 - 2009 recession hit and decimated the housing market . The rate continued to fall until 2016 , but has begun to increase again since then .
