This statistic is part of a survey from 2016 showing the private body grooming habits of women and men under 30 years old in the United Kingdom ( UK ) . The results reveal that almost half of women under 30 years remove all of their pubic hair ( 47 percent ) . Most young men trim ( 45 percent ) , but a notable share ( 34 percent ) claim to `` do nothing '' .
