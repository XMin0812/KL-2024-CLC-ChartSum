Since 1964 , voter turnout rates in U.S. presidential elections have generally decreased across all age groups , except for those over the age of 65 . From 1988 onwards , there has been a direct correlation with voter participation and age , as people become more likely to vote as they get older . Participation among eligible voters under the age of 25 is the lowest of all age groups , and in the 1996 and 2000 elections , fewer than one third of eligible voters under the age of 25 participated , compared with more than two thirds of voters over 65 years .
