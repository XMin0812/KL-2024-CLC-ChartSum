Throughout U.S. history , the difference in the proportion of electoral votes has often been several times larger than the difference in the popular vote . For example , in the 1980s Ronald Reagan received roughly nine and eighteen percent more popular votes than his respective candidates , however he then received roughly seventy percent more electoral votes than both candidates . There are many critics of the electoral college system , whose main argument is that the most popular candidate is not always elected president , while its defenders argue that the system gives proportional representation to all Americans , and prevents candidates from ignoring the interests of those in less-populated states . The United States uses the electoral college system to elect its presidents , which generally means that the most popular candidate in each state is then given that state 's allocation of electoral votes ( based on the state 's population ) . Since 1968 , there have been 538 electoral votes on offer in each election , meaning that he first candidate to reach 270 electoral votes is declared President . Since 1824 , a popular vote has been held among the general public in order to determine the most popular candidate in each state ( although women were not granted suffrage until 1920 , while black and Native American voters faced widespread voter suppression until the 1960s ) . Because of the electoral college system , the proportion of popular votes won by a candidate may be very different than the proportion of electoral votes , and this has caused some instances where the candidate with the most electoral votes is declared President of the United States , despite losing the popular vote ( such as in 2000 and 2016 ) .
