Kentucky has taken part in every U.S. presidential election excluding the first in 1789 ( when it was a part of Virginia ) , and has voted for the overall winner in 36 out of 58 elections , giving a success rate 62 percent . Throughout its history , Kentucky has generally voted for the more conservative option of the major party candidates ; siding primarily with the Democrats from the 1850s until the 1950s , before switching to the Republicans in recent decades ( although there were some exceptions to these trends ) . The only times where Kentucky did not vote for a major party nominee were in 1792 , where the unaffiliated George Washington won an uncontested re-election , and in 1860 , where it voted for the Constitutional Union 's nominee in the lead-up to the American Civil War . Kentucky has been considered a `` red state '' since the 1960s , although it did support Jimmy Carter in 1976 , and Clinton in 1992 and 1996 , however Republicans have won at least 56 percent of the popular vote in the past five elections . In both the 2016 and 2020 elections , Donald Trump won the state with a 62 percent share of the popular vote .
