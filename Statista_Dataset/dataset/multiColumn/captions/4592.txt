The National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) is an independent agency of the US Government , founded in 1958 , taking over from the dissolved National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics ( NACA ) . It oversees the US space program , as well as research into aeronautics and aerospace , while the Advanced Research Projects Agency ( ARPA ) oversees military matters regarding space . NASA was founded at the beginning of what has become known as the 'space race , ' a period of Cold War history where the Soviet Union and the US competed for dominance and superiority of space technology . In 1957 the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite ( Sputnik ) into the earth 's orbit , marking the first significant development in the space race . While the relationship between the US and Russia is much friendlier today , with both countries cooperating on space endeavors such as the International Space Station ( ISS ) , it is important to remember that tensions between both nations were very high during this time , and the launch of the satellite displayed the potential ability to launch nuclear warheads from space .
