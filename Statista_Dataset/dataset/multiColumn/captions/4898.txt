As early as 1319 , allegations of well-poisoning had been levelled at leper communities in Europe , in an attempt to demonize and ostracize this group of society . In France and Spain in 1321 , the `` leper 's plot '' developed into a widespread conspiracy , claiming that leper communities were acting on the orders of the Jews or Spanish Moors , poisoning water supplies in an attempt to spread disease among Christians . Under royal decrees , many lepers were then tortured into confessing to these acts , and were subsequently burnt at the stake ( although this was often carried out by vigilante mobs before it could be done by the courts ) . After the initial hysteria in 1321 , the involvement of lepers was quickly dismissed , and a papal bull was introduced to grant protection to leper communities in France ; this however did not dispel the myths surrounding the Jews ' involvement in the conspiracy , and the issue emerged again a few decades later .
