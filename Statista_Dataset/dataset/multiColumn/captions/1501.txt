This graphic shows the estimated population of the world from the point where scientists can reasonably predict the total number of homo sapiens in 10,000BCE , until the year 2000CE  . From the data we can see that Asia has consistently been the most populated continent ( not including the Middle East and CIS areas , most of which would be included in the majority of modern 'Asia ' statistics ) , and the least populated continent has mostly been Oceania , although it was more heavily populated than other areas , such as North America , in very early times . We can also see dips in population between 1100CE and 1500CE in Eurasia , due to a number of plagues and epidemics that swept across the area , and also between 1500CE and 1900CE in the Americas , as a result of European arrival in the continent , where the population of Latin America took almost four centuries to reach it 's pre-1500CE level again . In more recent times we can see that increased urbanization and scientific/medical advances have contributed to massive population growth across the world , particularly in Asia , The Americas and Europe , and then later in Africa , which now has the fastest growth rate out of all the continents .
