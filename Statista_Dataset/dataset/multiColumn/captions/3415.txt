This statistic shows the amount of registrations of newly diagnosed cases of pancreatic cancer in England in 2018 , by age group and gender . With a total of 863 cases in 2018 , the group most affected by pancreatic cancer in terms of number of cases was that of 70 to 74 year old men . It should of course be noted that the number of people in England in each age group varies and is therefore not necessarily a reflection of susceptibility to pancreatic cancer .
