Since 2016 , digital advertising spending has been slowing down , with growth decreasing year-on-year for all formats . Whilst social media and online video saw the highest declines in investments , growth in expenditures will remain above 10 percent for both formats until 2020 . Conversely , display , paid search and classifieds ad expenses are expected to dive less severely , but spending on these will not grow more than 10 percent in the same year .
