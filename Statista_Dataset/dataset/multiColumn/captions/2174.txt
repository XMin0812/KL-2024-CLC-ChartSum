As of the final quarter of 2020 , Hulu 's SVoD only service reportedly generated an average monthly revenue of 12.59 U.S. dollars per paying subscriber . The figure recorded in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal year was slightly higher at 12.67 U.S. dollars in revenue per paying Hulu user , whilst for Hulu with Live TV and SVoD , an increase of over 13 dollars was reported . Disney attributed the decrease in ARPU from Hulu with SVoD only to lower retail pricing and a shift in its subscriber base due the Disney+ bundle offer .
