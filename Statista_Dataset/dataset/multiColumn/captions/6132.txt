The only times where South Dakota voted Democrat were for William Jennings Bryan in 1896 , FDR in both 1932 and 1936 , and then for LBJ in his landslide victory in 1964 ; there was also one occasion where South Dakota voted for a third party nominee , this was in 1912 when it voted for former-president Theodore Roosevelt as he ran on the ticket of the Progressive Party . In the 2020 election , Donald Trump won the popular vote in the Mount Rushmore State by a comfortable 26 percent margin . As of 2020 , no U.S. president has come from South Dakota , although both Democratic nominees in the 1968 and 1972 elections , former vice president Hubert Humphrey and George McGovern respectively , were born in South Dakota ; despite this , Richard Nixon carried South Dakota on both occasions . For most of its history , South Dakota was allocated four electoral votes ; this number did peak at five votes between 1912 and 1928 , however it has been at just three since 1984 , which is the lowest possible number .
