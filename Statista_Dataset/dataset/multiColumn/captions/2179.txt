Article One of the U.S. Constitution states that only the House of Representatives has the power to impeach a president , and if an overall majority votes in favor of impeachment , charges are then brought before the Senate where a two third majority is needed to convict the president and , most likely , remove them from office . In the history of the United States , attempts of impeachment were made against several sitting presidents , however only three were ever impeached ; these were Andrew Johnson , Bill Clinton and Donald Trump ( although Nixon was also sure to have been impeached and removed from office , had he not resigned before votes could be taken ) .
