In 2018 , the sales volume of passenger cars in Italy decreased for the first time since 2014 . This contraction can be attributed to the introduction of the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure ( WLTP ) in Europe in September 2018 . Manufacturers slowed down deliveries as a result of the new regulation , which imposed stricter certification procedures for emission targets â€“ for example , Real Driving Emission ( RDE ) test cycles . Diesel vehicles were most affected by the introduction of the new standards , as their sales volume passed from 1.1 million units in 2017 to 770 thousand units in 2019 . In 2019 , sales of petrol cars outnumbered those of diesel cars .
