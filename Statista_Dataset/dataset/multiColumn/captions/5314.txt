Traditionally in the United States , voters who identify as white have the highest turnout rate of all major ethnic groups ; when white voters of non-Hispanic origin ( defined as European Americans , Middle Eastern Americans and North African Americans ) are analyzed separately , the turnout rate increases further . In the past four decades , turnout among non-Hispanic white voters has fluctuated between 59 and 67 percent , between three and five percent more than all white voters , and the rate was eight percent higher than the national average in the most recent election . In the five most recent elections , over seventy percent of non-Hispanic white people aged 65 and above have voted in presidential elections . In contrast to this , the youngest age bracket of non-Hispanic white voters , those aged 18 to 24 years old , had a turnout rate of just 37 percent in some years ; this group still generally has the highest turnout rate among all ethnicities of this age , although black voters aged 18 to 24 did have the highest turnout rate in the 2008 and 2012 elections .
