Since 1824 , when the popular vote was first used to determine the overall winner in U.S. presidential elections , the share of the population who participate in these elections has gradually increased . Despite this increase , participation has never reached half of the total population ; partly due to the share of the population below the voting age of eighteen , but also as many potential voters above the age of eighteen do not take part , or are ineligible to vote . For example , in the 2016 election , approximately twenty million U.S. adults were ineligible to vote , while over 94 million simply did not participate ; in this election , Donald Trump won the electoral college with 63 million votes , which means that 19.4 percent of the total U.S. population ( or 27.3 percent of eligible voters ) voted for the current president .
