As of 2019 , around half of people with an income of less the 50 thousands dollars per year state that they typically do not see any movies in theatres each month . The middle income group ( those that make between 50 and 100 thousand dollars per year ) has the highest average for monthly theatre visits , with over 60 percent seeing at least one film per month . The obvious constraints to movie consumption are likely related to income and free time . Middle income level consumers seem to represent the optimal balance between these two constraints which allows for the greatest movie consumption .
