In 2019 , U.S. media corporation WarnerMedia generated 13.55 billion U.S. dollars from subscriptions to its Turner and Home Box Office segments , up from 7.4 billion in the previous year . Due to the acquisition of Time Warner by AT & T and its subsequent renaming ( now WarnerMedia ) , results for previous years are not considered meaningful and as such were not reported by AT & T in 2018 or 2019 .
