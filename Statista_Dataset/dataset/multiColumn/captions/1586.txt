This statistic shows the share of grocery retail sales in the United Kingdom ( UK ) in 2014 with a forecast for 2019 , by retail channel . Superstore and hypermarket share of sales is predicted to fall from 42.2 percent to 34.9 percent in 2019 , with share expected to increase through discounter , convenience and online channels . Grocery shopping in the United Kingdom ( UK ) is currently dominated by the 'big four ' supermarkets , Tesco , Sainsbury 's , Asda and Morrisons , although the market share of grocery stores has been increasingly volatile . With the introduction of the discounters , as well as the increasing prevalence of online shopping , fewer consumers are conducting their main shops in supermarkets , instead opting for more convenience-based formats . Thus online shopping is expected to experience the largest increase in value along with discounters , while other channels will remain comparatively stagnant .
