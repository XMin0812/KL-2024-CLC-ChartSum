The Battle of Second Manassas ( also known as the Second Battle of Bull Run ) , was fought between General Robert E. Lee 's Confederate forces , and the Union 's Army of Virginia , commanded by General John Pope . The battle began on August 28 , 1862 , when Major General Thomas J . 'Stonewall ' Jackson captured a Union supply depot ( on the 27th ) and then held a nearby defensive position awaiting Pope 's response , which came in the form of an assault on the 28th and 29th . During this time , Jackson 's colleague , General James Longstreet , maneuvered his own forces in order to outflank Pope as he attacked Jackson 's position . The subsequent attack on the 30th , by both Confederate armies on Pope 's forces , became the largest coordinated assault of the war , which crushed the Union army on two fronts . Almost twenty percent of the Union forces involved became casualties , and this number would have been much higher had the Union rearguard not successfully protected their retreat .
