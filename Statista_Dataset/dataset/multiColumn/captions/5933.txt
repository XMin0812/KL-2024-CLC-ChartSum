Directly following the Battle of the Wilderness , the Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant marched his Union forces south in an attempt to prevent General Robert E. Lee from retreating further . Some Confederate troops arrived at the tactical crossroad that was the Spotsylvania Court House before the Union forces , and began preparing defenses . The fighting itself began on May 8 , 1864 , and continued until May 21 , with an estimated 30 thousand casualties over the two week period . Both sides claimed victory in the battle , as the Confederate army did not give up its position , however the Union inflicted irreplaceable casualties on the Confederate 's numbers . This was the second major battle of Grant 's Overland Campaign against Lee 's forces , which lasted from May 4 to June 24 , 1864 , and resulted in an overall strategic Union victory , but at a very heavy cost for both sides .
