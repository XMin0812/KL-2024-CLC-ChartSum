Once described by US President Herbert Hoover as `` a great social and economic experiment '' , we now know that Prohibition was ultimately a failure , that led to increased crime and violence and gave way to a new era of mafia and mob influence in the United States . On January 17 , 1920 , the Volstead Act came into effect and the manufacturing , transportation , importation and sale of alcohol became federally prohibited across the United States , and while consumption was not a federal offence , it was sometimes prohibited on a state level . Opposition to Prohibition remained strong throughout the 1920s , and the Great Depression ( starting in 1929 ) led many to advocate for the sale and taxation of alcoholic beverages in order to ease the US ' economic woes . One of the reasons why Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected in 1932 was due to his promise of ending Prohibition , which he did with the Ratification of the 21st Amendment on December 5 , 1933 .
