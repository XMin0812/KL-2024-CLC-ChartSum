In 2019 the leader satisfaction scores for the heads of the two main political parties , Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn , plummeted to their lowest scores since November 2016 , at negative 44 for Corbyn and negative 48 for Theresa May . May 's highest satisfaction score was recorded in February 2017 when she had a satisfaction score of 19 percent , while Corbyn 's highest score was one percent in August 2017 . Although Boris Johnson taking over from May in Summer 2019 prompted an increase in the net satisfaction score for the Prime Minister , the score was still a negative one .
