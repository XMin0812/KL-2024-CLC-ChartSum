The state of Ohio has taken part in 55 U.S. presidential elections , voting for the nationwide winner in 45 of these elections , giving a success rate of 82 percent . With this high success rate and relatively high number of electoral votes , Ohio has generally been viewed as a battleground state throughout U.S. history . Before 2020 , Ohio had voted for the overall winner in every election since 1964 , and had only failed to choose the winner in three elections since 1888 . In the 2020 election , however , the Buckeye State somewhat lost its reputation as a bellweather state , as Donald Trump carried the popular vote by an 8.1 percent margin ; the same margin as his victory in 2016 .
