From April 2 to 12 , 2020 , nitrogen dioxide air pollution levels in Bogot√° , Colombia have decreased by 68 percent when compared to the first ten days of the previous month . In Lima , Peru , a reduction of 61 percent was observed . These results are at least partially related to a reduction in industrial activity and traffic circulation in urban areas , a consequence of partial and total lockdown measures enforced around the world in an attempt to limit the spread of the coronavirus pandemic . In Santiago , Chile , in contrast , despite partial lockdown measures established , air pollution has increased by 80 percent in the beginning of April , when compared to a month earlier .
