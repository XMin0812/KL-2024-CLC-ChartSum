There were almost 700 thousand slaves in the US in 1790 , which equated to approximately 18 percent of the total population , or roughly one in every six people . By 1860 , the final census taken before the American Civil War , there were four million slaves in the South , compared with less than 0.5 million free African Americans in all of the US . Of the 4.4 million African Americans in the US before the war , almost four million of these people were held as slaves ; meaning that for all African Americans living in the US in 1860 , there was an 89 percent  chance that they lived in slavery .
