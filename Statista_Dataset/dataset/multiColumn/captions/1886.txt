In the history of the modern Olympics , the 100 meter sprint has arguably been the most high profile and popular event of each Summer Games . The men 's event has been included in every Olympics , while the women 's event has been included since 1928 . Athletes from the United States have won both events more than any other nation , with sixteen victories in the men 's race and nine in the women 's , although the past three Olympics have seen Jamaican athletes top the podium in both events . Despite having a population of less than three million people , Jamaica has dominated this event since 2008 , claiming eleven of the eighteen medals available . While measurements were not as accurate in earlier years , the men 's time has fallen from 12 seconds in 1896 , to 9.6 seconds in 2012 , while the women 's has fallen from 12.2 seconds in 1928 , to 10.5 in 1988 . Since the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles , the gold medal times have remained below ten seconds for men , and eleven seconds for women ( although altitude allowed for many new records to be set at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City , which is 2.2km above sea level ) .
