From 1950 to 1955 , the worldwide crude birth rate was just under 37 births per thousand people , which means that 3.7 percent of the population , who were alive during this time had been born in this five year period . Between this five year period , and the time between 2015 and 2020 , the crude birth rate has dropped to 18.5 births per thousand people , which is fifty percent of what the birth rate was seventy years ago . This change has come as a result of increased access and reliability of contraception , a huge reduction in infant and child mortality rate , and increased educational and vocational opportunities for women . The continents that have felt the greatest change over this seventy year period are Asia and Latin America , which fell below the global average in the 1990s and early 2000s , and are estimated to have fallen below the crude birth rate of Oceania in the current five-year period . Europe has consistently had the lowest crude birth rate of all continents during the past seventy years , particularly in the 1990s and 2000s , when it fell to just over ten births per thousand , as the end of communism in Europe caused sweeping demographic change across Europe . The only continent that still remains above the global average is Africa , whose crude birth rate is fifteen births per thousand more than the world average , although the rate of decrease is higher than it was in previous decades .
