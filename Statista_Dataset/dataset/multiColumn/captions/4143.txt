Investors choose different ways to shape and refer to that segment of their portfolio - other popular terms are socially responsible investment ( SRI ) , environmental , social and governance investment ( ESG ) , or sustainable development goals investment ( SDG ) . Regardless of the exact wording of the product , popularity has been growing , and especially among young investors . As of November 2019 , seven percent of the new investors aged 18 to 34 chose a new investment for its ethical fund or product . In comparison , among all new investors , only five percent did . More in-depth information can be found in the Statista dossier on socially responsible investments ( SRI ) in Europe .
