In the U.S. midterm elections , there is a large disparity in voting participation among eligible voters under the age of 25 , and all other age groups . Since 1986 , statistics show that voter participation directly correlates with age , with those in higher age brackets more likely to vote in midterm elections ; a similar correlation has appeared in presidential elections since 1988 , although turnout in these elections is significantly higher . From 1966 until 2014 , voter participation gradually decreased ( although sometimes fluctuated ) among voters under 65 years of age ; while it generally increased ( and plateaued around sixty percent ) among those older than 65 . The 2018 midterms saw large increases in voter participation across all age groups , with the largest increases coming from younger voters ; in spite of this , eligible voters over the age of 65 were still more than twice as likely to vote as those under 25 .
