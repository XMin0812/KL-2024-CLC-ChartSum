According to a study held in June 2020 , just 14 percent of adults said that they strongly preferred seeing a movie for the first time in a theater , and 36 percent said that they would much rather stream the film at home than visit a cinema . Preferences for watching a new release in a cinema instead of via a streaming service in the United States changed significantly between 2018 and 2020 , signaling a shift in consumer behavior and potentially a risk for movie theaters in the country . Also important to note is the effect of the coronavirus on consumer confidence . There was a drop in the share of movie fans willing to visit cinemas between March and June 2020 , likely the result of consumers fearing the risk of infection and feeling more comfortable viewing movies in the safety of their own home .
