Since 1979 the United Kingdom has participated in nine European Parliamentary Elections , with the most recent election taking place in May 2019 . In this election , the newly-formed Brexit Party won the highest share of the votes at 31.6 percent , followed by the Liberal Democrats who won 20.3 percent of the vote . After the emergence of the eurosceptic United Kingdom Independence Party in the 1999 elections , the dominance of the two largest parties in the UK , Labour and Conservative , soon faded , with UKIP winning the highest share of the vote in the 2014 European Elections .
