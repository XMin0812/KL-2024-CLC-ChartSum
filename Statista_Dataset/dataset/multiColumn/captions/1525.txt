This statistic displays the distribution of the grocery market among leading grocery retailers in the United Kingdom ( UK ) from 2011 to 2015 . Tesco held the largest share at 25 percent in 2011 , dropping by six percentage points to a 19 percent share of the grocery retail market by 2015 . Prior to the popularity of the discounters , the grocery retail market was dominated by the 'big four ' supermarkets : Tesco , Sainsbury 's , Asda and Morrisons . On the back of the economic recession and growing inflation , however , consumer behavior has shifted in favor of cheaper alternatives and discount supermarkets . The resulting 'price wars ' has led to supermarkets lowering their prices and the highest share of food volume sales on promotion in Europe . Crucially , this has caused increased volatility in the grocery retail market and , as of 2017 , Aldi overtook the Co-operative to become the fifth largest supermarket in the UK according to data from Kantar Worldpanel .
