Of all the major battles of the American Civil War , the Battle of Stones River had the highest percentage of casualties . Approximately 76 thousand men took part in the battle , with just under one third becoming casualties . The battle itself took place at the turn of 1862 - 1863 , and began on the morning of December 31 , when both the Union army of Major General William S. Rosecrans , and the Confederate army of General Braxton Bragg , planned to attack one another , with Bragg launching his attack first and catching the Union army by surprise ( much like at the Battle of Shiloh ) . A strong defense , quickly mounted by Brigadier General Philip Sheridan , was able to prevent a total catastrophe , and the Union were then able to establish a defensive line which held out through repeated attacks from Bragg 's men . Due to the threat of Confederate cavalry and high Union casualties on the first day , Rosecrans ensured that the convoys of wounded men were heavily guarded . When Bragg saw this he assumed that the Union army was retreating , and decided not to press the attack . On the final day the tide had turned in the Union 's favor , and they were able to use their strategically placed artillery to repel the Confederate army , inflicting heavy casualties in the process . Although the overall result was inconclusive , it was a morale boost for the Union , who had suffered a string of defeats in the previous battles .
