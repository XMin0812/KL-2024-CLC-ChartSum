The 10,000 meter race has been a permanent fixture in the men 's roster since 1912 , replacing the five mile race ( approximately 8,000m ) ; while the women 's event was not introduced until 1988 . The reigning champions are Mo Farah of Great Britain and Almaz Ayana of Ethiopia . Ayana set the world and Olympic record for women with her win in 2016 . Ethiopia 's Kenenisa Bekele set the men 's Olympic record with his win in 2008 , and also set the world record in 2005 , with a time of 26 minutes , 17.53 seconds . In early Olympic Games , Finnish men dominated the 10,000m , however Ethiopian performances in recent years have seen them claim ten gold medals , to Finland 's seven . Finland 's Paavo Nurmi was the first athlete to win two 10,000m golds in 1920 and 1928 , and several others have gone on to match this feat , with the last three winners in the men 's 10,000m taking back-to-back golds . Paavo Nurmi remains the only Olympian to have won the gold medal in the 1500m , 5000m and 10,000m races .
