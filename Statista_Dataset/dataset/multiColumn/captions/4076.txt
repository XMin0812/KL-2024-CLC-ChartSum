The Border states were the five slave states who did not secede from the Union and did not declare allegiance to either side . Their name comes from the fact that they bordered the free states of the Union to the north , and the slave states of the Confederacy to the south . Generally speaking , the border states supported the Union more often than the Confederacy , however this changed throughout the war . For example , Missouri sent 39 regiments to fight in the siege of Vicksburg : 17 to the Confederacy and 22 to the Union . The involvement of men from these states was also complicated , as family members quite often found themselves on opposing sides of the battlefield . From the graph we can see that , while all states ' populations grew , the smaller states had a lower growth rate , as they saw a higher proportion of conflict . Missouri had , by far , the highest growth rate during this decade , due to an increase in westward migration , as well as a lower rate of conflict .
