A survey held in the United States in January 2020 found that opinions on anime movies varied significantly across age groups , with 27 percent of adults aged 18 to 29 years old saying that they had a very favorable impression of anime films . This was double the share of adults between 30 and 44 years and nine times the share of those aged between 55 and 64 years old who said the same . Older generations were less likely to be anime fans and many had not heard of it , especially those aged 55 or above .
