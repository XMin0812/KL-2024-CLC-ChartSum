However , it has since been predicted that Apple 's streaming service will not achieve this goal , whilst 2025 subscriber estimates for Disney+ have increased . The source also anticipated that HBO Max could attract over 28 million subscribers by 2025 . The estimates for the year 2025 made in May 2020 were made in light of the COVID-19 pandemic , which saw an increase in SVoD subscriptions globally .
