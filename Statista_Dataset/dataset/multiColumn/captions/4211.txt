The 200 meter sprint has been included as a men 's event in all Olympic Games since Paris 1900 , and a women 's 200 meter event was introduced in London 1948 . In the early 1900s , the 200m sprint was often held on a straight track ( similar to the 100m sprint ) , but it has been in it 's current format since the 1950s , where the first half of the race is along the curve of a 400m running track , while the second half is along a 100m stretch . Athletes from the US have had the most success in these events , winning 17 golds and 46 overall medals in the men 's , and six golds in the women 's ; however , the past two decades have seen Jamaica emerge as the most dominant nation , with Jamaican female athletes now tied with US athletes on twelve overall medals .
