The 1860 election cemented the Republican Party 's position as one of the two major parties in U.S. politics , along with the already-established Democratic Party . Since this time , all U.S. presidents have been affiliated with these two parties , and their candidates have generally performed the best in each presidential election . In spite of this two-party dominance , there have always been third-party or independent candidates running on the ballot , either on a nationwide , regional or state level . No third-party candidate has ever won a U.S. election , although there have been several occasions where they have carried states or split the vote with major party candidates . Today , the largest third-party in U.S. politics is the Libertarian Party , who are considered to be socially liberal , but economically conservative ; in the 2016 election , their nominee , Gary Johnson , secured just over three percent of the popular vote , while their latest candidate , Jo Jorgenson , is thought to have received just over one percent of the vote in the 2020 election .
