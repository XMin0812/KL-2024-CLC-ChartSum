According to recent data , in 2020 it is forecast that 36 percent of total NAND memory capacity will go towards smartphones . NAND flash memory was originally developed by Toshiba in the early 1980s . It allows greater storage density and lower cost per bit than the alternative NOR flash , but is more useful as a secondary storage device than as primary storage , as it does not support a random-access external address bus .
