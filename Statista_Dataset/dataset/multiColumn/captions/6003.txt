The hammer throw has been included in all Olympic Games as a men 's event since 1900 , and the women 's event was introduced one hundred years later , at the Sydney Games in 2000 . The men 's hammer weighs 7.26 kilograms and is 1.21 meters in length , while the women 's hammer weighs 4 kilograms and is 1.19 meters in length . The traditional technique involves contestants standing still and swinging the ball over their head twice to build some momentum , before swinging the ball while rotating their body four or five times ( while moving gradually towards the field boundary ) , in order to build up as much speed and power as possible before releasing the hammer . The Olympic records are currently held by the Soviet Union 's Sergey Litvinov , with a throw of 84.8 meters in 1988 , and Anita Włodarczyk of Poland , with a throw of 82.29 meters in 2016 . Włodarczyk also holds the women 's world record of 82.98 meters ( she is the first and only woman to throw more than 80 meters ) , while Yuriy Sedykh throw of 86.74 meters for the Soviet Union in 1986 still stands as the men 's world record . In the early Olympic Games , the United States dominated the event , taking gold in the first six hammer throw events , however ( ex- ) Soviet and Eastern European athletes have dominated the sport since the Second World War . The US ' John Flanagan won the first three gold medals , and remains the only athlete to ever win more than two Olympic golds in the sport ; although Anita Włodarczyk could match this feat if she claims victory in Tokyo 2020 .
