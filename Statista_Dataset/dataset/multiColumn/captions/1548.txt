The Battle of Shiloh took place on April 6 and 7 , 1862 , in southwestern Tennessee , during the American Civil War . The Union forces were led by Major General Ulysses S. Grant , while General A. S. Johnston , and later General P. G. T. Beauregard , commanded the Confederate armies . The battle began when Johnston launched a surprise attack against a Union encampment , driving them from the camp towards a sunken road that they used as their defensive line . The rebels continued to attack the Union line , but could not break down their defenses , and General Johnston was fatally wounded during the days ' attacks . Command was taken over by General Beauregard late on the 6th , who decided to halt the attack overnight after seeing how drained the Confederate forces had become . This proved to be a grave mistake however , as it allowed Union reinforcements from Ohio to arrive , and early on the 7th Grant launched his own surprise attack on the enemy , eventually overpowering and defeating them . Approximately 2.5 thousand men died in the battle , and a further 21 thousand were wounded , missing or captured , making it the bloodiest battle of the American Civil War at that time .
