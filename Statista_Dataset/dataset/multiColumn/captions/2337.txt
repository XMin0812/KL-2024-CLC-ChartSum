YouTube users in the Netherlands were predominantly younger than 39 , according to survey results from 2017 and 2018 . The online video platform was especially popular among the 15- to 19-year-olds : 86 percent of the Dutch respondents in this age group said they used Google 's video-sharing platform . The source does not mention whether the penetration rate only covers desktop use , app use on smartphones/tablets or both . The numbers shown here , however , exclude the use of YouTube Music in the Netherlands , as this service arrived later in 2018 .
