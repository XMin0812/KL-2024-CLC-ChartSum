Pennsylvania has taken part in every U.S. presidential election , correctly voting for the nationwide winner in 47 out of 59 elections , giving a success rate of eighty percent . Since 1828 , Pennsylvania has voted for the Democratic nominee in twenty elections , and the Republican Party 's nominee in 26 elections ( including all but one elections from 1860 to 1932 ) . The only time where Pennsylvania did not vote for a major party candidate was in 1912 , where it granted its 38 electoral votes to Theodore Roosevelt , who was running as the candidate of the newly-formed Progressive Party . After voting Democrat in all elections between 1992 and 2012 , Pennsylvania voted red in 2016 , as Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton by less than one percent of the popular vote . In 2020 , Joe Biden flipped Pennsylvania blue again by 1.2 percent of the popular vote . Pennsylvania proved to be the decisive state in the week following the 2020 election , as the returns of mail in ballots gradually swung the result in Biden 's favor , following a strong early showing from Donald Trump ; the development of these results eventually signaled that Joe Biden had ( provisionally ) obtained the 270 electoral votes needed to win the election , leading all major news outlets to declare him the winner .
