According to the source , in the baseline scenario , the coronavirus epidemic lowers Poland 's GDP growth by 0.4 percentage points in 2020 . In this scenario , the most important are disruptions in supply chains , which lower GDP growth by 0.20 percentage points . In the pessimistic scenario , the coronavirus epidemic lowers Poland 's GDP growth by 1.3 percentage points in 2020 . In this scenario , the problems in the internal market , such as a drop in domestic demand , are estimated to lower GDP growth by 0.57 points . The implementation of the pessimistic scenario would mean that Poland 's economic growth in 2020 would decrease from 3.7 percent previously forecast to around 2.0 percent . It is worth to notice that one of the biggest banks in Poland - mBank , estimated that GDP will reach 1.6 percent in 2020 . The key assumption in both situations was that the epidemic is a temporary phenomenon , i.e. , it would last for a maximum of several weeks , after which the economy would gradually recover .
