This statistic shows the amount of registrations of newly diagnosed cases of breast cancer in England in 2018 , by age group and gender . With a total of 5,894 cases in 2018 , the group most affected by breast cancer in terms of number of cases was that of 65 to 69 year old women . It should of course be noted that the number of people in England in each age group varies and is therefore not necessarily a reflection of susceptibility to breast cancer .
