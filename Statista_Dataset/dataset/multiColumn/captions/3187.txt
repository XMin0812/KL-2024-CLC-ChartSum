This graph shows the number of used cars sold between 2008 and 2014 according to age bracket . The reason for the higher volume of cars sold aged nine or above is probably threefold ; it is simply a larger category , older cars tend to be cheaper which is what people are looking for now , and finally car owners are probably holding on to their cars for longer rather than selling to buy new cars so there simply are not as many younger second-hand cars on the market .
