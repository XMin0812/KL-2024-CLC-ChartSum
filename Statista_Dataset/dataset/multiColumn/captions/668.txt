June 2020 , the third full month of the coronavirus pandemic in the Netherlands , reveals a signficant increase in the unemployment rate . In January , the non-seasonally adjusted employment rate for ages 15 until 75 years was said to be 3.3 percent , whereas in March it increased to 3.6 percent . This contrasts the figure for March , which was slightly below than what was predicted back in December 2019 , when economic models forecasting an annual average of 3.5 percent . When compared to the same months in previous years , however , unemployment in 2020 was significantly lower . The figure for May 2020 , for example , was over half that of May 2015 .
