In the first quarter of 2020 , London was the most expensive city to rent a furnished one-bedroom flat among the 18 leading European cities surveyed . At 1,756 euros per month , rent in London was approximately twice as high as in Turin . All cities except for Barcelona saw the average rent increase between the first quarter of 2019 and 2020 . The highest growth was observed in Vienna where rental prices soared by 12 percent . One of the main factors driving high rents across European cities is the same as any other consumer driven business . If demand outweighs supply , prices will inflate . The drive for high paid professionals to be located centrally in prime locations , mixed with the low levels of available space , high land and , construction costs all help keep rental prices increasing .
