The state of West Virginia was established in 1863 , and has taken part in all U.S. presidential elections between 1864 and 2016 . In these forty elections , West Virginia has awarded the majority of its electoral votes to the nationwide winner 29 times , giving a success rate of 73 , percent . West Virginia has always been won by a major party candidate , with the state voting for the Republican and Democratic nominees twenty times each . There were , however , two occasions where faithless electors voted for a candidate who did not win the popular vote in the Mountain State ; these were in 1912 , when one elector cast a ballot for Woodrow Wilson , and in 1988 , where one elector protested the lack of accountability for electors in the electoral college system by reversing the positions of the presidential and vice presidential nominees . West Virginia has gone through phases of aligning itself with major parties , voting mostly for the Republican nominee between 1896 and 1928 , and then siding mostly with Democratic nominees between 1932 and 1996 . Between 2000 and 2016 , however , Republican winning margins grew with each election , and in the 2016 election , Donald Trump received over two thirds of the popular vote . In the 2020 election , West Virginia proved to be a comfortable victory for Donald Trump , who won the popular vote by a margin of almost forty percent . As of 2020 , no U.S. president has ever been born in West Virginia ( including the eight born in Virginia before West Virginia seceded in 1863 ) . The only major party candidate to have come from West Virginia was John W. Davis in 1924 , who actually lost the popular vote in his home state by a five percent margin . West Virginia 's allocation of electoral votes grew steadily in the late 19th century , and peaked at eight votes between the 1912 and 1960 elections . However , the population has fallen from over two million people in 1950 to just 1.8 million people in 2020 , and its allocation of electoral votes has also decreased during this time . As West Virginia 's population continues to fall , its allocation of electoral votes is expected to drop to just four in the 2024 election , which would be the lowest in the state 's history .
