The Twenty-third Amendment to the U.S. Constitution granted citizens of the District of Columbia the right to vote in U.S. presidential elections ; since this came into effect in 1964 , the nation 's capital has voted for the Democratic Party 's nominee in every election , making this the longest ongoing streak in U.S. presidential elections . The record for the longest ever streak in the history of U.S. presidential elections belongs to Vermont ( Republican ) and Georgia ( Democrat ) , who each voted for the same party 's candidate in 27 consecutive elections between 1852 and 1960 .
