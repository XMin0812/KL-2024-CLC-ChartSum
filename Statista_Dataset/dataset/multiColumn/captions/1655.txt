Although the United States lead the all-time Summer Olympics medal table , and the Soviet Union have the highest average medal tally per event , it is Finland who has the highest medal count per capita . With a combined total of 303 Olympic medals , and a population of 5.54 million people in 2020 , this means that Finland has won almost 55 medals per one million inhabitants . Finland has participated and won medals in every Summer Olympics since 1908 , and dominated several athletics and wrestling events in the first half of the twentieth century . Although Finland 's medal count has generally been in decline since the 1950s , the legacy left by athletes such as Paavo Nurmi , Heikki Savolainen and Ville Ritola has kept Finland at the top of this list .
