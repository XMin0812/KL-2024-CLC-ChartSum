Bulgaria gained its independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1878 , and for the next century the population grew at a relatively constant rate , before falling into decline from the 1980s until today . The ratio of men to women in Bulgaria has remained fairly level before the 1980s , with the difference never exceeding 100,000 . It was only in the 1980s when the numbers began to drift further apart , with the male population decreasing at a higher rate than females . A difference of more than 100,000 people appeared in 1988 , and 200,000 at the turn of the millennium . The difference in Bulgaria 's male and female populations has remained around 200,000 people for the past two decades , as the overall population has fallen from around eight million to below seven million people . This drop in population size has been attributed to the economic collapse which followed the end of communism in Eastern Europe , causing many to leave the country in search of work elsewhere . Bulgaria also has one of the lowest birth rates in the world , with just 9 births per 1,000 people in 2020 .
