The men 's 800m is classified as a middle-distance race , and has been a staple men 's event at the Olympics since the Athens 1896 . A female event was introduced once in 1928 , but was then dropped as some press reports claimed that it was too long a distance for women and caused distress among the athletes ( although many competitors and spectators refuted these claims ) ; the women 's event was re-introduced in 1960 and has been a permanent fixture since . Unlike shorter races , competitors in the 800m are allowed to converge in the inside lane once they pass the first band ( after the first 100 meters ) ; for this reason , the 800m is seen as a more tactical race that requires a balance of both aerobic and anaerobic ability , in contrast to the sprints across the shorter distances .
