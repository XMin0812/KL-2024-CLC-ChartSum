The overall fertility rate of the world has dropped from 5 children per woman in 1950 , to 2.5 in 2020 , which means that women in 2020 will , on average , halve half the amount of children during their lifetime than women did seventy years ago . This change has come as a result of increased access and reliability of contraception , a huge reduction in infant and child mortality rate , and increased educational and vocational opportunities for women . The continents that have felt the greatest change over this seventy year period are Asia and Latin America , where women today will have approximately three to four fewer children than their counterparts in the 1950s . While most continents saw significant declines in fertility rates in the 1960s and 1970s , Africa did not see this development until much later , although the fertility rate is expected to reach 4.4 in 2020 , with further reduction still to come , as the other continents ' rates plateau .
