The Third Plague Epidemic began in the mid-1800s in Yunnan , China , ( an area that is still a natural reservoir for the Yersinia pestis bacteria ) and had a huge death toll across Asia in the next century . While plague was confined to the Yunnan region for some decades , the mass displacement and social upheaval caused by the Taiping Rebellion saw millions flee the area , bringing the disease to other parts of the country . A plague epidemic then emerged in British-controlled Hong Kong in 1894 , where merchants then unknowingly transported infected rats to other parts of the empire along various trade routes .
