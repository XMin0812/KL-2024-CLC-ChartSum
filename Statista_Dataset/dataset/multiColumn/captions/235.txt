The gross domestic product or GDP refers to the total market value of all goods and services that are produced within a country per year . It is an important indicator of the economic strength of a country . Both Catalonia and Spain as a whole experienced a decrease in GDP between 2008 and 2013 . However , during the last year under review , the GDP of Catalonia had risen to its highest point at 242.3 billion euros , with the GDP of the whole of Spain amounting to 1.2 trillion euros . The development of GDP in Spain was thus closely linked to the average change of GDP in the Eurozone , with GDP of Spain having risen by significantly since 2009 .
