When inspecting the construction of the Panama Canal in 1906 , Theodore Roosevelt became the first President of the United States to make an international visit while in office . Every president since then , except for Herbert Hoover ( although he did visit ten Latin American countries as President-elect ) , has visited at least one foreign country while in office , and the number of countries visited has generally increased over time . The most commonly visited foreign countries by U.S. presidents are Canada and France , which have been visited 41 times by 13 and 12 different presidents respectively . The trips to Canada include nine separate visits by Franklin D. Roosevelt , which is the highest number of trips made by a U.S. president to any single country . While the U.S. ' northern neighbor is one of the most frequently visited countries , its southern neighbor , Mexico , has only been visited 33 times . However , 14 presidents have visited Mexico , which is the highest number of individual presidents to visit a country , along with Italy ( although Donald Trump is the first president since Herbert Hoover not to make this trip ) . Of the ten most frequently visited countries ; two border the U.S. , six are in Europe , and Japan and South Korea round off the list .
