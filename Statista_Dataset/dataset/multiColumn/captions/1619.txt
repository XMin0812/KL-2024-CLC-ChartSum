Between 1964 and 2016 , turnout among black voters in U.S. presidential elections fluctuated between 48 and 62 percent , with the highest turnouts coming in 2008 and 2012 , when Barack Obama ( the first African American candidate from a major party ) was the Democratic candidate . Voter turnout has always been lowest among those under 25 years of age , although younger black voters did participate in high numbers in the 1960s , during the civil rights movement , and again in 2008 , during Obama 's first election campaign ; young black voters also participated in higher numbers than white voters of the same age between 2000 and 2012 . In 1964 , black voters over the age of 65 voted at a similar rate to those in the 18 to 24 bracket , however they have consistently had the highest turnout rates among black voters in recent years , overtaking voters in the 45 to 64 years bracket ( whose voting rate has consistently been between 60 and 70 percent ) in the 1996 election . Black voters in the 25 to 44 age bracket have traditionally voted in line with the overall average among black voters , although at was slightly above the average until 1984 , when increased participation among older voters then pushed it below the average .
