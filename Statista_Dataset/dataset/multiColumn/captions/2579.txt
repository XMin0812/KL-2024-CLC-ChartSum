The Great Smallpox Pandemic of 1870 to 1875 was the last major smallpox epidemic to reach pandemic level across Europe . The outbreak has its origins in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 to 1871 , where unvaccinated French prisoners of war infected the German civilian population , before the virus then spread to all corners of Europe . The death rates peaked in different years for individual countries ; with the highest numbers recorded in 1871 for the German states , Belgium and the Netherlands , while death rates peaked in Austria , Scotland and Sweden in later years ( the states that peaked in 1871 were closer in proximity to the frontlines of the Franco-Prussian War ) .
