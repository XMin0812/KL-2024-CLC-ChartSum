Depending on the reach and level of vaccination within Europe 's various states in the 1870s , smallpox had a varied impact on various age groups . For infants below the age of one year , smallpox was responsible for between 15 and 30 percent of all deaths in the given regions , as many of these babies had not yet been vaccinated and were at a high risk of succumbing to the virus . In states where the vaccination of infants was not compulsory , such as the Netherlands , Berlin ( Prussia ) and Leipzig ( Saxony ) , the share of deaths due to smallpox among young children remained high , while it was relatively low in Hesse and Scotland , who had introduced mandatory vaccination in 1815 and 1864 respectively .
