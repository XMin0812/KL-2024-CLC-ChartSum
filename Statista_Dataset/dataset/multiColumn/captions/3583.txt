The Battle of the Wilderness was the first encounter of Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant and General Robert E. Lee 's forces , during Grant 's Overland Campaign in May and June 1864 during the American Civil War . This campaign took place over eight weeks in Virginia , as Grant 's union troops pushed the Confederate forces further back through Virginia , culminating in the Sieges of Richmond and Petersburg . Although the Union sustained heavier casualties than the Confederacy , they emerged victorious from the campaign , as they had inflicted a higher proportion of casualties to the South . It was during this point of the war where the Union 's superior numbers proved instrumental in determining the outcome of the war .
