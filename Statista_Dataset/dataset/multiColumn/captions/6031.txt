The outbreak of coronavirus in Poland will significantly reduce labor demand . According the source , bankruptcies of companies , dismissals of employees , the need to take care of children due to closed educational institutions , and limited possibilities of remote work in some sectors have a direct impact on the labor market during the pandemic . In total , nearly 4.2 million people work in industries strongly exposed to the economic consequences of the lockdown . Of this figure , three million are employed , and just over one million are business owners and co-owners . More than half of the jobs at risk are in the trade .
