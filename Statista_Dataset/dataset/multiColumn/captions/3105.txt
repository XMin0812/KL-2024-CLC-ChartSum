A survey exploring movies and viewing preferences in the United States revealed that 59 percent of U.S. adults said that they would prefer to watch foreign language films dubbed into English than see the original feature with subtitles . Preferences varied according to the ethnicity of survey respondents , and data showed that African Americans and white adults were more averse to watching subtitled foreign movies than adults in other ethnic groups . By contrast , the majority of surveyed Hispanic adults said that they would rather watch a foreign film with subtitles than a dubbed version . Interestingly , the survey also revealed that Hispanics were more likely than white or African American adults to have learned another language , potentially making these respondents more receptive to foreign language films in their original format due to their affinity with or knowledge of other languages in general .
