The shot put has been an Olympic event for men since the inaugural games in 1896 , and the women 's event has featured in all Olympic Games since 1948 . Although the sport is seen by many as an iconic Olympic event , there is no record of it ever featuring in the Ancient Games . The earliest records of competitive stone throwing trace back to the Scottish Highlands , in competitions that gradually evolved into the Highland Games ; a tournament that greatly influenced Pierre de Coubertin when he was reviving the modern Olympics in 1896 . The modern event involves competitors resting a ball ( weighing 7.26 kilograms for men and 4 kilograms for women ) against their neck , and then creating as much momentum with their body as they can , in order to throw the ball as far as possible .
