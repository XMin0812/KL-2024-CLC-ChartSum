This statistic shows the preferred times of the day for viewing television among the Italian population aged between 16 and 75 in 2017 , broken down by service type . While the majority of respondents were most likely to watch TV at night regardless of the medium ( over 60 percent in all three cases ) , a Pay TV user was almost twice as likely to view TV at around dinner time as a VOD service subscriber or streaming user .
