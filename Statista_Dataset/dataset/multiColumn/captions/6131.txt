Since 1892 , Montana has cast ballots in 33 U.S. presidential elections , voting for the nationwide winner in 24 of these , giving a success rate of 73 percent . Montana has always voted for either of the major party candidates , and in early years , Montana did not have a strong allegiance with any of the major parties , voting with the nationwide winner in all elections between 1904 and 1956 . However , Montana has been considered a safe red state for the past few decades , voting Republican in all elections since 1952 , except in 1964 and 1992 . No U.S. president has ever been born in or resided in Montana when running office , nor has any other major party candidate . Montana 's allocation of electoral votes has been relatively low since its admission to the union , rising to four votes from 1912 until 1988 , although it has had the joint-lowest of any state since 1992 . Donald Trump won the state by a 16 percent margin in the 2020 election , following his twenty point victory there in 2016 .
