This statistic shows the results of a survey asking the British public for their favourite flavour of crisps , by age . Favourite flavours varied quite dramatically by age . For the 60 and over group ready salted ( the longest running flavour ) was most popular , with almost half of respondents voting it as their favourite . For the 40 to 59 year olds cheese and onion ranked first ( 40 percent ) and salt and vinegar for the 25 to 39 year olds ( 35 percent ) . The youngest age group ( 18 to 24 ) had the most varied result , possibly due to the wide variety of flavours already available throughout their lifetime , as noted by the source .
