With Abraham Lincoln 's victory in the 1860 presidential election , the Republican Party 's cemented their position as one of the two major political parties in the United States . Since 1860 , candidates from both parties have faced one another in 41 elections , with the Republican candidate winning 24 elections , to the Democrats ' 17 . In the U.S. , the electoral college system is used to elect the president ; for most states , this means that the most popular candidate in each state then receives that state 's allocation of electoral votes ( which is determined by the state 's population ) . In the majority of elections , the margin of electoral votes has been over thirty percent between the two major party candidates , and there were even some cases where the winner received over ninety percent more electoral votes than the runner-up . The largest margins for the Republican Party occurred in the aftermath of the American Civil War , in the inter-war period , after the Second World War , and then again with Nixon , Reagan and George H. W. Bush campaigns in the 1970s and 80s . For the Democratic Party , the largest victories occurred during First and Second World Wars , and for Lindon B. Johnson and Bill Clinton in the second half of the twentieth century . In the past six elections , the results of the electoral college vote have been relatively close , compared with the preceding hundred years ; George W. Bush 's victories were by less than seven percent , Obama 's victories were larger ( by around thirty percent ) , and in the most recent elections involving Donald Trump he both won and lost by roughly 14 percent . The percentage of electoral college votes are often very different to the percentage of the popular vote received by each candidate in the elections , as the popular vote differences tend to be much smaller .
