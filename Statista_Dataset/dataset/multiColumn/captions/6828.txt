Part VII of the Treaty of Versailles dealt with the reparations accrued by Germany as a result of the First World War . While the treaty itself avoided giving exact figures about the amount the German government owed ( instead highlighting the duties of the planned Reparations Commission ) it did outline some initial reparations that would later be subtracted from the final sum owed . One of these initial specifications instructed the German government to transfer thousands of heads of livestock to France and Belgium , in three monthly installments . The largest payments were for 140,000 milk cows , and 120,000 sheep , with the largest share of animals going to France .
