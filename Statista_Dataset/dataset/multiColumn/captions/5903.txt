In the past four centuries , the population of the United States has grown from a recorded 350 people around the Jamestown colony of Virginia in 1610 , to an estimated 331 million people in 2020 . The pre-colonization populations of the indigenous peoples of the Americas have proven difficult for historians to estimate , as their numbers decreased rapidly following the introduction of European diseases ( namely smallpox , plague and influenza ) . Native Americans were also omitted from most censuses conducted before the twentieth century , therefore the actual population of what we now know as the United States would have been much higher than the official census data from before 1800 , but it is unclear by how much . Population growth in the colonies throughout the eighteenth century has primarily been attributed to migration from the British Isles and the Transatlantic slave trade ; however it is also difficult to assert the ethnic-makeup of the population in these years as accurate migration records were not kept until after the 1820s , at which point the importation of slaves had also been illegalized .
