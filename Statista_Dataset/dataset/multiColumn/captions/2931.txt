On September 14 , 2020 the United Kingdom 's House of Commons voted in favor of the 'UK internal market bill ' by 340 votes to 263 . The relatively banal name of the bill hides its potential to be political dynamite , with its implicit purpose being to undermine a key article of the withdrawal agreement regarding Northern Ireland . As the withdrawal agreement was backed by the House of Commons on December 20 , 2019 , and ratified on February 1 , 2020 , any reneging on the UK 's part would see the country breaking international law .
