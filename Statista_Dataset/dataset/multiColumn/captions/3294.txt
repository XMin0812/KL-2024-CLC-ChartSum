Minnesota has taken part in all U.S. presidential elections since 1860 , and has voted for the nationwide winner in thirty of these 41 elections , giving a success rate of 73 percent . Minnesota has traditionally voted for the more liberal of the major party nominees in each election , voting almost-exclusively Republican between 1860 and 1928 , and then voting almost exclusively Democrat since 1932 . The only times where it did not vote in this trend was in the 1912 election , where it voted for former President Theodore Roosevelt of the Progressive Party ; in both of Eisenhower 's landslide victories in the 1950s , and Richard Nixon 's re-election victory in 1972 . In the 2004 election in Minnesota , it is assumed that one elector accidentally cast their ballot for John Kerry 's running mate , John Edwards ; as the ballots were cast secretly and nobody has claimed responsibility for the incident , the exact details remain unclear . No U.S. president has ever been born in or resided in Minnesota upon taking office , although both Democratic nominees in the 1968 and 1980 elections , had represented Minnesota in the Senate before running for president .
