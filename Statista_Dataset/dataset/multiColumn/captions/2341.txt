In 2019 , U.S. media giant WarnerMedia generated a total revenue of 14.36 billion U.S. dollars through Warner Bros. , and 13.12 billion from Turner . Due to the acquisition of Time Warner by AT & T and its subsequent renaming ( now WarnerMedia ) , results for previous years are not considered meaningful and as such were not reported by AT & T in 2018 or 2019 .
