The 1,500 meter race has been a permanent fixture for men since the first modern Olympics in 1896 , while the women 's event has taken place since 1972 . The Olympic records for men and women were set by Kenya 's Noah Ngeny in 2000 ( 3 minutes , 32.07 seconds ) and Romania 's Paula Ivan in 1988 ( 3 minutes , 53.96 seconds ) ; Olympic gold medalist Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco and silver medalist Genzebe Dibaba of Ethiopia set the world records in 1998 ( 3 minutes , 26 seconds ) and 2015 ( 3 minutes , 50.07 seconds ) respectively . In the past three decades , Kenyan and North African athletes have won the most gold medals across both events , however Great Britain has claimed more golds than any other nation , with five in the men 's event and one in the women 's . The men 's event in 2016 saw the slowest finishing time since 1932 ; this was due to the athletes ' reluctance to take the lead early in the race .
