A study held in 2019 revealed that 7.1 percent of men reported spending between five and seven hours watching an online series in one sitting , and just under two percent said that they did so for more than ten hours at a time . Whilst for women the percentages were slightly lower , binge-viewing is increasingly commonplace among fans of digital originals on platforms like Netflix , which often publish an entire series in one hit rather than encouraging or forcing viewers to enjoy a show episode by episode .
