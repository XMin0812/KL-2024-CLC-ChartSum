This statistic shows British public opinion from September 18 to 19 , 2014 , and one week later on September 24 to 25 , 2014 , on whether the RAF should join the US-led air strike operations against Islamic State/ISIS . On the second date , more people approved of the potential UK operations , whereas fewer people disapproved or were unsure . This could be due to increased media portrayal of ISIS as violently anti-Western .
