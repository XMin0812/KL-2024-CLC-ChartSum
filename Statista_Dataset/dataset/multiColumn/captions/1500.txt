The influenza pandemic of 1918 , known as the Spanish Flu , was one of the deadliest and widespread pandemics in human history . The scale of the outbreak , as well as limitations in technology , medicine and communication , create difficulties when trying to uncover accurate figures relating to the pandemic . Estimates suggest that the virus , known as the H1N1 influenza virus , infected more than one quarter of the global population , which equated to approximately 500 million people in 1920 . It was responsible for roughly 25 million fatalities , although some projections suggest that it could have caused double this number of deaths . The exact origins of this strain of influenza remain unclear to this day , however it was first noticed in Western Europe in the latter stages of the First World War . Wartime censorship in Europe meant that the severity of the pandemic was under-reported , while news outlets in neutral Spain were free to report openly about the impact of the virus ; this gave the illusion that the virus was particularly strong in Spain , giving way to the term `` Spanish Flu '' .
