The statutory interest rate in the Netherlands remained stable between 2016 and 2020 . Statutory interest rate in the Netherlands or wettelijke rente is the interest due as a compensation for losses due to delays for an obligation to pay a sum of money . In other words , it is a rate a creditor can demand by law from a defaulting debtor . This is different then , for example , the long-term interest rate , or yield on ten-year government bonds , in the Netherlands or the interest rate for new mortgages . Statutory interest for commercial transactions applies to deliveries to companies and the government , whilst in the case of deliveries to consumers the statutory interest rate for non-commercial transactions applies . Statutory interest can not be claimed if there is a different rate of interest in a contract .

In the last years , the statutory interest rate for non-commercial transactions decreased from three percent in July 2012 to two percent in January 2017 .
