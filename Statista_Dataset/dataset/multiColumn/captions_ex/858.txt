United States presidential elections are quadrennial elections that decide who will be the President and Vice President of the United States for the next four years . Voter turnout has ranged between 54 and 70 percent since 1964 , with white voters having the highest voter turnout rate ( particularly when those of Hispanic descent are excluded ) . In recent decades , turnout among black voters has got much closer to the national average , and in 2008 and 2012 , the turnout among black voters was higher than the national average , exceeded only by non-Hispanic white voters ; this has been attributed to Barack Obama 's nomination as the Democratic nominee in these years , where he was the first African American candidate to run as a major party 's nominee . Turnout among Asian and Hispanic voters is much lower than the national average , and turnout has even been below half of the national average in some elections . This has been attributed to a variety of factors , such as the absence of voting tradition in some communities or families , the concentration of Asian and Hispanic communities in urban ( non-swing ) areas , and a disproportionate number of young people ( who are less likely to vote ) .
