This statistic shows the population of the United States in the final census year before the American Civil War , shown by race and gender . From the data we can see that there were almost 27 million white people , 4.5 million black people , and eighty thousand classed as 'other ' _ . The proportions of men to women were different for each category , with roughly 700 thousand more white men than women , over 100 thousand more black women than men , and almost three times as many men than women in the 'other ' category . The reason for the higher male numbers in the white and other categories is because men migrated to the US at a higher rate than women , while there is no concrete explanation for the statistic regarding black people .
