This graph shows the population distribution of Chinese people living abroad in 2009 and 2019 , by continent , according to official Taiwanese sources . By the end of 2019 , around 2.3 million people of Chinese birth or descent who were living overseas were living in Europe . The figures of the source are in most cases higher - in some cases considerably higher - than figures published by the UN , as not only first generation migrants are included , but also their descendants .
