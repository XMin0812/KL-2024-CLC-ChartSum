Norway had the highest price tags on new passenger cars sold in 2018 . Like four years previous , Norwegians had to dig deeper into their pockets than any of their European neighbors , with prices roughly 20,000 euros higher than the EU-28 average . Reasons for automobiles being so costly in Norway are partly due to higher tax rates than in most other European countries . A VAT of 25 percent is imposed on all new and used passenger vehicles imported into the country , while registration tax on cars considers weight , CO2 and NOx emissions of the car . These incentives contribute to making larger , heavier vehicles using petrol and diesel engines more expensive than anywhere else in Europe . The only vehicles exempt from VAT and tolls were electric cars . Electric vehicles are also extremely popular in Norway compared to most other countries ; Norwegian buyers are able to spend more on high-tech models .
