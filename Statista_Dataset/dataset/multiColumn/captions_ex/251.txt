The statistic depicts the brand value of the most valuable English football teams from 2011 to 2020 . Manchester United had a brand value of 1.46 billion U.S. dollars in 2020 . A brand is defined here as the trademark and associated intellectual property . Football clubs are made up of a mixture of fixed tangible assets ( stadium , training ground ) and disclosed intangible assets ( purchased players ) with brand value . To calculate brand values the Royalty Relief method was used . This approach assumes the company does n't own their brand and must license it from a theoretical third party . The method determines how much it would cost to do this . The English Premier League , which is a private company wholly owned by its member clubs , is the highest organized level of professional football ( soccer ) in England . In the league , 20 clubs compete for the championship playing each other twice during the course of the season . The league works on a system of promotion and relegation in conjunction with the subordinate Football League . The best three teams of the Football League are promoted each year and the worst three of the Premier League are relegated .
