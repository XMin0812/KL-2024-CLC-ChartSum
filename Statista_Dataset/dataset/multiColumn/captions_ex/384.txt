In South Korea , approximately 72.19 percent of the population was between 15 and 64 years old in 2019 , while those above the age of 64 made up around 15 percent . The youngest generation made up an even smaller percentage than the elderly , but were the only group that did not increase in size over the last decade , partly due to a decrease in births since 2007 .
