It is projected that electricity generated by most energy sources worldwide , with the exception of liquids , will increase in the coming years . Electricity from renewable sources is expected to experience the largest growth of up to 21.66 trillion kilowatt hours in 2050 , from almost 7 trillion kilowatt hours in 2018 . This projection sees increased consumption from all fuel sources , except for coal , where demand seems to have plateaued . Conventional sources like coal are increasingly being replaced by natural gas , renewables , and nuclear power .
