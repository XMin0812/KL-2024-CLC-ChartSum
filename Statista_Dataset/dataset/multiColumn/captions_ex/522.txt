Since 2017 , the popularity of diesel cars has been decreasing . The decline could be attributable to a number of factors , from the negative perceptions of diesel associated with the â€˜ Dieselgate ' scandal , to fears of a tightening regulatory environment . The average price of diesel fuel steadily increased . A peak in prices was recorded in October 2018 , when it reached 136.7 pence per liter . In January 2020 , this figure stood at 1.3 British pounds per liter .
