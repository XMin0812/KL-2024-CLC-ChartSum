Following the outbreak of the H1N1 influenza pandemic of 1918 , which came to be known as the Spanish Flu , the number of deaths due to influenza and pneumonia soared . Pneumonia was caused either by the influenza or by a bacterial superinfection that took hold due to the patient 's weakened state as a result of the influenza , for this reason , influenza deaths and pneumonia deaths were recorded together as one . Pennsylvania had the highest mortality rate due to the pandemic , where there were over 880 fatalities per 100,000 people ; meaning that approximately 0.9 percent of the state 's population died from the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 . When compared with the 1915 mortality rates , many states , such as California and Pennsylvania , saw their mortality rate due to influenza and pneumonia increase five-fold by 1818 , which was the worst year of the pandemic . While the mortality rate decreased significantly in the year 1919 , there was no US state where it fell to it 's pre-pandemic level , and the 1919 mortality rate was still double the pre-pandemic rate in some states such as California , South Carolina and Washington .
