The highest position of executive power has been held by a woman in just 58 countries , since 1960 . The first democratically elected female Prime Minister was Sirimavo Bandaranaike of Sri Lanka , who took over the leadership of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party when her husband was assassinated in 1959 . Bandaranaike successfully led her party to victory in three elections , in 1960 , 1970 and 1994 , however constitutional changes in the 1980s meant that her final term as Prime Minister was spent in a more ceremonial role , while the President now held the real executive power ( although the President at this time was also a woman ; Bandaranaike 's daughter , Chandrika Kumaratunga ) . Sri Lanka is one of just thirteen countries that has had more than one woman in the highest position of executive power , and most of these countries can be found either in the Indian sub-continent or in Northwestern Europe . Of these thirteen , New Zealand and Finland are the only countries to have had three female leaders , including the current Prime Ministers ; Jacinda Ardern and Sanna Marin .
