How high is the average student debt in the Netherlands ? In 2016 , a university ( in Dutch : WO ) graduate had a debt of around 10,700 euros . Newer numbers were not available , as the national system for student loans changed in 2015 . In 2015 - 2016 , the so-called basisbeurs ( a conditional loan a student would receive in the Netherlands , which would turn into a gift when he/she graduated within ten years ) was abolished . This currently means that if students need more money , they must loan it from the government . In 2017 , the Dutch government granted 2.4 billion euros worth of loans to students .
