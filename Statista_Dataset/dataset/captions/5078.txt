Whilst many Academy Award nominees are lucky enough to take home awards for their performances , some actors have received multiple nominations but thus far failed to secure a win . At the top of this ranking is Greg P. Russell , who has 16 nominations to his name , but is yet to win the coveted award . In 2019 , Diane Warren made the list after having received her tenth nomination for her song `` I 'll Fight '' from the documentary 'RBG ' _ , but failed to win an award that year .
