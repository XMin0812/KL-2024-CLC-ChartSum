The state of Belgium owes its name to Julius Caesar , who used the name `` Belgium '' to refer to the region in his narrative `` The Gallic Wars '' . After the fall of the Western Roman Empire , the region emerged as a cosmopolitan trading center , and was a collection of smaller duchies and states ( such as Flanders and Brabant ) , before modern history saw control of the region pass between France , the Netherlands and ( to a lesser extent ) Spain . Modern day Belgium emerged in 1830 following the Belgian Revolution when it gained independence from the Kingdom of the Netherlands . Throughout this time , the Belgian region was the setting of many conflicts between other European powers , which greatly affected the population development and demography of the area . From 1800 until the First world War , the population of Belgium grew steadily , and more than doubled in the nineteenth century .
