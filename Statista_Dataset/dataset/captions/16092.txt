The Plague of Justinian was the first major bubonic plague pandemic recorded in Europe , and was the first pandemic to ever be described or documented with any relative reliability . The plague takes its name from Emperor Justinian I , who ruled the Byzantine Empire ( Eastern Roman Empire ) at the time of the outbreak . The Byzantine capital of Constantinople ( also known then as Byzantium , and Istanbul today ) was the hardest hit city during the pandemic , and where the majority of sources are from . Until recently , it was only assumed that the outbreak was bubonic plague , due to the symptoms described by contemporary historians , but scientists were able to confirm that it was in fact Yersinia pestis ( the bacterium that causes plague ) in 2013 .
