Thermal efficiency of nuclear power stations oscillated over the years in the United Kingdom . Between 2010 and 2019 , figures decreased by roughly two percent , peaking at 40 percent in 2016 and 2017 . Thermal efficiency is the efficiency with which heat energy contained in fuel is converted into electrical energy . In 2019 , nuclear power stations had a thermal efficiency of 36.5 percent , which means that 36.5 percent of the energy in nuclear power was converted to electricity .
