Bosnia and Herzegovina 's total population grew at quite a steady rate from the early nineteenth century until the mid-1900s , increasing from 852,000 people in 1818 to 2.7 million in 1950 . Following the Second World War , the population grew at an even faster rate , reaching 4.5 million people by the end of the 1980s . Throughout this period , Bosnia and Herzegovina was never an independent country , as it belonged to the Ottoman Empire until 1875 , before it was then annexed by Austria-Hungary until the First World War , after which it became a part of Yugoslavia . During this time , ethnic Bosnians ( the majority of which were Muslim ) often faced oppression and persecution , and even mass genocide during the Second World War ( when it was briefly annexed by Croatia , which was a puppet state of Nazi Germany ) .
