The Ballon d'Or is an annual football prize presented by France Football . The award , voted for by football journalists , is given to the male player who was deemed to have played the best football over the previous 12 months . Unsurprisingly , two of the greatest footballers of all time , Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo , top the list of all-time winners . Messi won the title for a record-breaking sixth time in 2019 , while Ronaldo sits just behind him in second place with five trophies to his name .
