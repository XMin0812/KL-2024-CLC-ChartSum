This statistic shows the change in share of the total votes received by each party in the UK general elections from 2010 to 2015 . The major changes occurred outside of the two main parties . The Liberal Democrats , struggling with their image after five years of coalition government with the Conservatives , received 15.2 percent less votes than they did in a relatively successful 2010 . On the other end of the scale , UKIP increased their share by almost ten percent . While the SNP won 50 new seats in Scotland , this only translated to a 3.1 percent increase of the total votes due to the party only standing in the Scottish constituencies . The Green Party will also be encouraged by their increase .
