Andersonville Prison was one of the largest , and most overcrowded and unsanitary prison camps during the American Civil War . For this reason , almost one third of all prisoners died while in captivity in the prison . As Confederate records were so poorly maintained , there are no complete records for the entire war , however from March until August , 1684 , we know that over 7,700 Union soldiers died in captivity here . The most common causes for death were diarrhea and dysentery , and scurvy , which are both fast-spreading diseases , facilitated by poor and unhygienic living conditions . As a comparison , approximately 5.9 thousand Confederate POWs died from diarrhea or dysentery between 1861 and 1865 .
