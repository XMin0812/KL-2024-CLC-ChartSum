In the United Kingdom , the crude birth rate in 1800 was 37 live births per thousand people , meaning that 3.7 percent of the population had been born in that year . From 1800 until 1830 , the crude birth rate jumped between 35 and 45 , before plateauing between 35 and 37 until the 1880s . From 1880 until the Second World War , the crude birth rate dropped to just under fifteen births per one thousand people , with the only increase coming directly after World War One . After WWII , the United Kingdom experienced a baby boom , as many soldiers returned home and the economy recovered , however this boom stopped in the late 1960s and the crude birth rate went into decline again . From the late 1970s until today , the crude birth rate has remained between eleven and fourteen , and is expected to be 11.5 in 2020 .
