Throughout the nineteenth century , what we know today as Poland was not a united , independent country ; apart from a brief period during the Napoleonic Wars , Polish land was split between the Austro-Hungarian , Prussian ( later German ) and Russian empires . During the 1800s , the population of Poland grew steadily , from approximately nine million people in 1800 to almost 25 million in 1900 ; throughout this time , the Polish people and their culture were oppressed by their respective rulers , and cultural suppression intensified following a number of uprisings in the various territories . Following the outbreak of the First World War , it is estimated that almost 3.4 million men from Poland served in the Austro-Hungarian , German and Russian armies , with a further 300,000 drafted for forced labor by the German authorities . Several hundred thousand were forcibly resettled in the region during the course of the war , as Poland was one of the most active areas of the conflict . For these reasons , among others , it is difficult to assess the extent of Poland 's military and civilian fatalities during the war , with most reliable estimates somewhere between 640,000 and 1.1 million deaths . In the context of present-day Poland , it is estimated that the population fell by two million people in the 1910s , although some of this was also due to the Spanish Flu pandemic that followed in the wake of the war .
