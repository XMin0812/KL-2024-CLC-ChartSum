The outbreak of coronavirus in 2020 will have a massive impact on the functioning of most companies in Poland . More than 80 percent of entrepreneurs considered the exemption from social security contributions ( ZUS ) to be the most effective type of state aid as a result of the coronavirus outbreak . Nearly 70 percent of investors also expect exemption from tax payments , and every second company would like the government to subsidize sick pay . If the state of the epidemic in Poland continues until mid-April , the number of companies that will be forced to lay off all their employees as a result of the outbreak of coronavirus in 2020 will almost double .
