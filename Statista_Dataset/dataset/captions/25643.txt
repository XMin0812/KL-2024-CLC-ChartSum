The infant mortality rate in Norway , for children under the age of one year old , was over 140 deaths per thousand births in 1840 . This means that for all babies born in 1840 , roughly 14 percent did not survive past their first birthday . This rate fluctuated over the next sixty years , falling to just under one hundred deaths per thousand births at the turn of the twentieth century . From 1900 onwards , Norway 's infant mortality rate dropped further and is today one of the lowest rates in the world . Roughly 99.8 % of all babies lived past their first birthday in the period between 2015 and 2020 .
