In Japan , the crude birth rate in 1800 was 29.6 live births per thousand people , meaning that approximately three percent of the population had been born in that year . From 1800 to 1865 , Japan 's crude birth rate rose gradually to around 34 births per thousand people , before dropping relatively sharply to 25 over the next ten years . This was a time of great social and economic reform in Japan , as the country became increasingly urbanized and industrialized . Japan 's crude birth rate reached it 's highest recorded point in the early 1920s , where the number was almost 35 births per thousand people , and since then it has been decreasing gradually . There were two times in the twentieth century where Japan 's crude birth rate increased , after the Second World War , and during the period of economic prosperity in the 1960s and 70s . Since 1975 , Japan 's crude birth rate has gradually decreased to it 's lowest recorded rate ever , and is expected to be at just 7.5 births per thousand people in 2020 , making it the second lowest in the world ( behind Monaco ) .
