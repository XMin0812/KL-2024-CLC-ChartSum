The statistic shows total U.S. arms imports in the years 2000 to 2019 expressed in TIV . The TIV is based on the known unit production costs of a core set of weapons and is intended to represent the transfer of military resources rather than the financial value of the transfer . The TIV is expressed here in million constant U.S. dollars as of 1990 . In 2019 , the U.S. arms imports totaled to about 1.05 billion constant ( 1990 ) U.S. dollars . The depicted import value is only an indicator and does not correspond to the actual financial value of the transfers .
