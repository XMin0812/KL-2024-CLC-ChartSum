This statistic shows the results of a survey that asked British adults which types of tea , if any , they ever drink in Great Britain ( GB ) in 2014 . English breakfast tea ranked highest with a 52 percent share of respondents , followed by Green tea ( 23 percent ) and Earl Grey ( 22 percent ) . A majority of British consumers drink tea on a daily basis , with earlier times in the day the peak period for tea drinking . Tea can be drank with milk as 'white ' or without as 'black ' _ , of which both methods are almost equally popular . Levels of consumption , however , are on the decline as the United Kingdom moves closer to becoming a nation of coffee drinkers rather than tea drinkers , as seen in the rising value of the market for hot drinks . Other tea types , such as fruit and herbal teas , are also gaining ground as consumers seek the health and wellness benefits of such products .
