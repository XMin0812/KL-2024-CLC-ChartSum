According to the OECD , household indebtedness ratio presents the total outstanding debt of households as a percentage of gross disposable income of households . The debt of households largely consists of loans , primarily home mortgage loans , but also other types of liabilities such as consumer credit ( e.g . credit card , automobile loans ) . A ratio above 100 percent shows that the level of debt outstanding is larger than the annual flow of disposable income . In France , the ratio of household indebtedness to gross disposable income has increased between the first quarter of 2013 and the second quarter of 2020 . As of the second quarter of 2020 , the household indebtedness ratio was 120 percent .
