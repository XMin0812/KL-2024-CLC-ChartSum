This statistic shows the change in construction costs of houses in the Netherlands compared to one year earlier from 1996 to 2018 . In 2018 , construction costs increased with 2.6 percent when compared to the previous year . This percentage change is slightly higher than in other years , indicating a faster growth of construction costs . In recent years , the housing market has continued to rise in the Netherlands due to low mortgage rates , a recovering economy and a high level of consumer confidence . For example , the average selling price of houses was higher in 2016 than in 2013 , when prices reached a low point . In 2017 , real estate prices are expected to increase with seven percent as a high number of sales , combined with an increasingly scarce supply , are expected to push the housing price up . In the four largest municipalities , the demand of housing outweighs the supply . In December 2016 , the average number of houses for sale in the municipality of Amsterdam was approximately 1,800 with this number reaching an average of 4,300 in December 2014 .
