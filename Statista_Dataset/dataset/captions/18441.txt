In 1800 , the population of the islands which make up the territory of the Philippines had a population of approximately 1.89 million . The population of the archipelago would grow steadily throughout the 19th century , reaching almost 6.5 million people by 1900 . However , the population would begin to rise much more rapidly following the country 's independence from the United States in 1946 , as post-war economic aid from the United States and expansive modernization projects by the Philippine government would lead to a significant rise in standards of living and result in a post-war baby boom . This growth would remain steady well into the 21st century , and while the rate of population growth has fallen somewhat in recent years , the population of the Philippines is expected to continue its increase in the coming years , and in 2020 , the Philippines is estimated to have a population of just under 110 million , which is almost twelve times larger than the Philippines ' population in 1920 .
