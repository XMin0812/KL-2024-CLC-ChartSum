The infant mortality rate in Mexico , for children under the age of one year old , was 121 deaths per thousand births in 1955 . This translated into over twelve percent of children born that year not surviving past their first birthday . Over the course of the next 65 years , this number fell to fourteen deaths per thousand births by the 2015 to 2020 period . Although this number is approximately double the rate of neighboring United States , it is still significantly lower than the global average .
