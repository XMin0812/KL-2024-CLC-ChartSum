In the final vote in the 2020 Iowa Caucus , Bernie Sanders had 26.5 percent of the statewide popular vote . This compares to 25.1 percent for Pete Buttigieg . The winner is generally determined by the number of `` State Delegate Equivalents '' ( SDEs ) , not the popular vote . SDEs are derived from the result in each caucus precinct , meaning the winner of the popular vote may not be the overall winner . This is indeed the case in the final results , which saw Pete Buttigieg having a narrow lead over Bernie Sanders .
