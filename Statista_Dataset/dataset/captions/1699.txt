Once a major powerhouse of the British economy , the coal industry was the lifeblood of several regions , providing employment for more than one million workers before the 1930s . Since that time , shifting attitudes towards coal and the emergence of alternative energy sources such as wind and solar have seen coal 's role in the energy mix diminish . By 1990 , the coal industry was still employer to some 50,000 people , however from 2016 onwards this figure had fallen to just one thousand .
