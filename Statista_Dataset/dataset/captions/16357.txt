This graph shows the total number of artillery and heavy guns used by the British forces during the First Battle of the Somme in 1916 . The Battle of the Somme took place from July 1 , until November 18 , 1916 with most of the bombardments coming in the week leading up to the July 1 , attack . The front line during the battle was over 22km long , and the German forces were so well entrenched ( up to 15m deep ) and protected that the week-long bombardment did not have its desired effect . This meant that when the soldiers rushed the German lines on the morning of July 1 , they suffered massive casualties , with 19,240 British fatalities on the first day alone ( making it the bloodiest day in British military history ) . The most commonly used gun was by far the 18PDR field gun , of which 808 were deployed during the Battle of the Somme . This gun was the most frequently used field gun used by the British Royal Field Artillery in the First World War . After these were the 4.5- and 6-inch Howitzers , and the 60 pounder guns . There was also a smaller number of naval railway-guns used to provide heavier fire and strategically targeted enemy roads and railways in order to disrupt their supply chain . The smaller guns and Howitzers were used not only to bombard the enemy , but also to destroy the masses of barbed wire that occupied no-mans-land and to clear a path for the soldiers ( although this was not always very effective ) .
