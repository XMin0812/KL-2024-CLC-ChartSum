Disability is an umbrella term , covering impairments , activity limitations , and participation restrictions . In Belgium , for a disability to be covered by insurance , it must be recognized by the public federal services . In Belgium 's region of Wallonia , the majority of disabled people were aged over 65 years . In fact , over 117,000 people of this age had a recognized disability in 2018 . To a lesser extent , around 21,400 people aged under 21 years were living in Wallonia with a recognized disability . There is no consistent definition of handicap in Belgium . However , all definitions rely on the interaction between an individual and his environment , and state that age plays a clear role in disability .
