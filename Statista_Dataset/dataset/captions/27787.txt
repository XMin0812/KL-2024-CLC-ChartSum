Motor vehicle sales have significantly decreased in Latin America since the COVID-19 outbreak . For example , approximately 1.3 million light vehicles were sold in Brazil in the first half of 2020 , representing a decrease of around 38 percent in comparison to the sales volume reported during the same period the previous year . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic on March 12 2020 . After this announcement , most Latin American countries began implementing movement restrictions , which partly explains the drop in the level of economic activity in the region .
