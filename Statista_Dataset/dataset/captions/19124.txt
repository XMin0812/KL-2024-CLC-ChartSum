The 1860 Presidential Election was one of the most divisive and influential elections in United States history . This election campaign was overshadowed by the issue of slavery , which was illegal in the northern states of the US , but was still allowed in the south ( although the slave trade had been banned for decades ) . Slavery caused the Democratic Party to split into the Northern and Southern Democratic parties , as those in the north were against slavery being made legal in the new western states , whereas those in the south believed that slave owners should be allowed to expand into these new territories without interference .
