In 2017 Dutch men , on average , had more sexual encounters via Tinder than women who used the dating app . According to numbers from a survey among heterosexual Tinder users , female users in the Netherlands found two sex partners via the app whilst their male counterparts found more than three . The source , however , does not provide a clear explanation why this is . It does refer to a larger development in the Netherlands , namely that singles , especially men between 18 and 39 years old , were more likely to use a dating app .
