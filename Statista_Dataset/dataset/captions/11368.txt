In late March of 2020 , many governments in Latin America imposed lockdowns in order to avoid the further spread of the virus SARS-CoV-2 . As a result of the isolation , a steep rise of gender violence and family abuse cases was identified in several countries in the region . For instance , Mexico 's domestic violence reports increased 25 percent in March 2020 , in comparison to the same month of the previous year . In Argentina , a hotline for sexual violence victims received more than two thirds more phone calls in April 2020 , compared to a year earlier . Argentina is one of the Latin American countries with the highest number of femicide victims .
