The European Parliamentary Elections of May 2019 saw nationalist and populist parties gain ground on traditional center-right and left parties , gaining a majority of the vote-share in Hungary , Italy and Poland , where populist parties have also found the most success in national elections . Populist parties also gained the most seats in France and the United Kingdom , with the latter witnessing a newly-formed 'Brexit Party ' take 29 of the UK 's 73 seats in the European Parliament . Elsewhere , the picture was more mixed for populist parties , with the much feared populist wave having a much smaller impact on the elections than was previously feared .
