Life expectancy in Russia was 29.6 in the year 1845 , and over the course of the next 175 years , it is expected to have increased to 72.3 years by 2020 . Generally speaking , Russian life expectancy has increased over this 175 year period , however events such as the World Wars , Russian Revolution and a series of famines caused fluctuations before the mid-twentieth century , where the rate fluctuated sporadically . Between 1945 and 1950 , Russian life expectancy more than doubled in this five year period , and it then proceeded to increase until the 1970s , when it then began to fall again . Between 1970 and 2005 , the number fell from 68.5 to 65 , before it then grew again in more recent years .
