This statistic displays the annual exchange rate ( average or standardized measure ) of the euro to the Swiss franc ( EUR CHF ) , according to data from the European Central Bank , from the introduction of the euro in 1999 up until 2019 . The average , or standardized , measure shows the calculation based on many observations throughout the period in question , which is different than an annual measure at point in time : this denotes concrete values as of specific day ( i.e . end of the year ) . Between the years of 2002 and 2007 , the average annual exchange rate of the euro to the Swiss franc noted an increase . In 2007 , the euro to Swiss franc annual average exchange rate was equal to 1.64 , which meant that one euro could buy 1.64 Swiss francs . By 2019 , this value had decreased overall , to a value of 1.11 which meant that one euro could buy 1.11 Swiss francs . This decrease in average annual euro to Swiss franc exchange rate is reflected in the monthly exchange rate , measured as of end-of-month in recent years .
