The fertility rate of a country is the average number of children that women from that country would have throughout their reproductive years . In the United Kingdom in 1800 , the average woman of childbearing age would have five children over the course of their lifetime . Over the next 35 years the fertility rate was quite sporadic , rising to over 5.5 in the 1810s and 1820s , then dropping to 4.9 by 1835 . This was during and after the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812 with the US , which was a time of increased industrialization , economic depression and high unemployment after the war . As things became more stable , and the 'Pax Britannica ' ( a period of relative , international peace and economic prosperity for the British Empire ) came into full effect , the fertility rate plateaued until 1880 , before dropping gradually until the First World War . The fertility rate then jumped from 2.6 to 3.1 children per woman between 1915 and 1920 , as many men returned from the war . It then resumed it 's previous trajectory in the interwar years , before increasing yet again after the war ( albeit , for a much longer time than after WWI ) , in what is known as the 'Baby Boom ' _ . Like the US , the Baby Boom lasted until around 1980 , where it then fell to 1.7 children per woman , and it has remained around this number ( between 1.66 and 1.87 ) since then .
