William Shakespeare spent the majority of his life between London and his hometown of Stratford-Upon-Avon , and while much of his work is set in his home country , most of his stories take place further afield , in mainland Europe and beyond . Of the 49 countries or empires used as settings in Shakespeare 's 37 canonized plays , the most frequently used location is England itself , which was used in 13 of his stories . Shakespeare 's histories make up the majority of these stories , as they deal primarily with the lives of English monarchs ( although many of these are also set in France , as the crowns were connected during the reign of the Plantagenets ) , while only one of Shakespeare 's comedies , The Merry Wives of Windsor , takes place in England .
