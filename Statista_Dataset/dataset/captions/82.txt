The New York Yankees are one of the most recognisable and valuable sports brands on the planet , no doubt in part due to their success on the baseball field . The New York franchise has won the World Series championships a record 27 times , with their closest rivals in terms of titles , the St. Louis Cardinals , having lifted the trophy 11 times . However , the Yankees fans have been starved of success in recent years as the team 's last World Series title came back in 2009 .
