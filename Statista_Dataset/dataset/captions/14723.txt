The fertility rate of a country is the average number of children that women from that country will have throughout their reproductive years . In 1900 , Mexican women of childbearing age would go on to have approximately 6.8 children on average over the course of their lifetime , however this number dropped to 5.6 by 1920 , partly because of the Mexican Revolution ( 1910 - 1920 ) . The fertility rate increased again over the course of the next sixty years , reaching 6.8 in the 1950s and 1960s , during the worldwide baby boom . However , Mexico 's fertility rate has been decreasing steadily since 1970 , and is expected to reach it 's lowest figure ever in 2020 , where the fertility rate will be 2.1 children per woman .
