In the eighteenth century , before vaccination was introduced to Sweden , smallpox epidemics were much more severe and regular than in the nineteenth century . Between 1774 and 1802 , epidemics in Sweden peaked roughly every five years , with the toll reaching over seven thousand deaths per million people in some years . When vaccination was introduced to Sweden in the early 1800s , it greatly decreased the total number of smallpox deaths per million people , with the number never exceeding one thousand deaths per million people in any year after 1809 . In actual numbers , there were roughly two thousand smallpox deaths per year in Sweden during the pre-vaccination era ; optional vaccination helped bring this average down to 623 deaths between 1802 and 1811 , while the number dropped to 176 between 1857 and 1866 when compulsory vaccination was introduced . Vaccination in Sweden became enforced in 1880 , where parents were punished with fines or imprisonment for failing to immunize their child , and this helped bring the average number of smallpox deaths to just two deaths per year over the next two decades . Although there were some cases and fatalities recorded in the late 1890s , naturally occurring cases of smallpox were eliminated in Sweden in 1895 , which made Sweden the second country in the world ( after Iceland in 1872 ) to successfully eradicate the disease .
