As of 2020 , Kenya had an internet penetration of approximately 87 . This high rate is mainly because Kenya is home to M-Pesa , which is a mobile wallet provider and the offered secure payment system encourages internet access . As of March 2019 , the majority of web traffic in leading digital markets in Africa originated from mobile devices in Nigeria , one of the countries with the biggest number of internet users worldwide , 74 percent of web traffic was generated via smartphones and only 24 percent via PC devices . This is connected to the fact that mobile connections are much cheaper and do not require the infrastructure that is needed for traditional desktop PCs with fixed-line internet connections .
