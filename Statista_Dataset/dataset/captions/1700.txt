The European Union is the main export destination for passenger cars exported by the United Kingdom . In 2019 , every second car sold by UK based manufacturers went to other member states of the EU.Total exports by the UK to the EU valued at around 170.5 billion British pounds that same year , accounting for 45.8 percent of all UK exports and making the EU its most important trading partner . In recent years the discrepancy between exports and imports has exacerbated the UK 's negative trade balance with the EU . This was largely due to a fall in exports recorded between 2011 and 2015 .
