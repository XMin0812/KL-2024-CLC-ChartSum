The fertility rate of a country is the average number of children that women from that country will have throughout their reproductive years . In 1855 , New Zealand 's women of childbearing age would go on to have approximately 5.3 children on average during their lifetime . Over the course of the next eighty years , the fertility rate would increase to 5.7 in 1870 ( due to the continued arrival of settlers to the islands ) , before decreasing to 2.4 in 1935 . During and after the Second World War , from 1935 until the 1970s , New Zealand experienced its 'Baby Boom ' _ , where the fertility rate increased to 4.1 births per woman in 1960 , before dropping sharply to two births per woman in 1985 , and it has remained between 1.9 and 2.2 since then .
