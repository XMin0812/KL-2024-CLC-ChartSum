According to a survey conducted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) , the number of hospitals in France steadily decreased between the years 2000 and 2012 , going from 3,120 to 2,657 within twelve years . Nevertheless , this trend was abruptly reverted during the first year of the Hollande Presidency : the number of hospitals jumped from 2,657 in 2012 to 3,192 in 2013 .
