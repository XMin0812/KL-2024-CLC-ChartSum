The household debt-to-income ratio among South Korean households has risen steadily over the last decade and amounted to 184.2 percent in 2018 . According to the OECD , household indebtedness ratio presents the total outstanding debt of households as a percentage of gross disposable income of households . The debt of households largely consists of loans , primarily home mortgage loans , but also other types of liabilities such as consumer credit ( e.g . credit card , automobile loans ) . A ratio above 100 percent shows that the level of debt outstanding is larger than the annual flow of disposable income .
