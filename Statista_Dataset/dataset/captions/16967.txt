In July 2020 , the year-on-year change in consumer prices was 0.6 percent in Finland . During the first half of 2019 , consumer prices were rising , but starting from September 2019 consumer prices remained below 1.0 percent . The lowest monthly inflation rate of -0.31 percent in April 2020 was mainly caused by lower petrol prices . Inflation or currency devaluation ( drop in the real value of money ) , is characterized by a rise in the prices of finished products ( consumer goods , capital goods ) . Vice versa , deflation or currency appreciation refers to an increase in the real value of money , allowing the buyer to purchase more goods and services with the same amount of money . Moreover , the consumer price index tracks price trends of private consumption expenditure .
