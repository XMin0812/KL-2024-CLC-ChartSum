This statistic shows the total healthcare expenditure per capita in the Netherlands from 1998 to 2019 ( in euros ) . In 2019 , the total healthcare expenditure per capita reached a value of approximately 6,120 euro . In the Netherlands , every resident or employee is obliged to take a basic health insurance to cover medical costs from , for example , visits to a general practitioner or the hospital . The Dutch government decides on the cover provided by this package and health insurance companies are obliged to accept everyone who meets the requirements , regardless of age or state of health . An important characteristic of Dutch health insurance , though , is the so-called `` principle of social solidarity '' : the overall costs of health care are paid by everybody . It is since 2008 , for example , compulsory from the age of 18 to pay a total mandatory excess before the basic health insurance reimburses medical costs . In this way , everybody contributes to certain types of healthcare such as maternity care . In 2018 , the total mandatory excess reached a value of 385 euros . In 2005 , the total health expenditure as share of GDP in the Netherlands reached a value of approximately 12 percent . Subsequently , this increased to approximately 17 percent in 2017 . In 2019 , the gross government expenses for primary care reached a value of approximately six billion euros .
