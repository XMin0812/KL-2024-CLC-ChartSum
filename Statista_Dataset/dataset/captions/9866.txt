From 1800 until the late twentieth century , there was a steady increase in Afghanistan 's population . Throughout the nineteenth century , Afghanistan became a battleground for the British Empire , who tried to control the area in order to prevent Russian expansion towards the British Raj . Despite resisting British invasion in the first Anglo-Afghan War , ( where the British Army was almost completely wiped out ) , the Second Anglo-Afghan War in 1880 , saw Britain seize control of the region . In contrast to the neighboring colonies on the Indian subcontinent , Britain did not colonize Afghanistan for economic purposes , therefore they did not invest in agriculture or infrastructure , nor introduce medicine in the same way they did in the Raj , and focused only on Afghanistan 's international affairs .
