As of March 2020 , during the outbreak of the novel coronavirus ( SARS-CoV-2 ) , which causes the COVID-19 , there were more than 38 million informally self-employed people in Brazil . It has been calculated that , in order to stop them from falling below the poverty threshold , each informal worker would need an income of roughly 250 Brazilian reals per month . Thus , the Brazilian government would need to spend 9.5 billion reals to keep that part of the workforce above the poverty threshold .
