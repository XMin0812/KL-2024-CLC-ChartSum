Life expectancy in Sweden was 36 in the year 1765 , and over the course of the next 255 years , it is expected to have increased to 82.6 by 2020 . Although life expectancy has generally increased throughout Sweden 's history , there was a lot of fluctuation around the turn of the nineteenth century due to The Napoleonic Wars and First Cholera Epidemic , and again in the 1910s due to the Spanish Flu Epidemic .
