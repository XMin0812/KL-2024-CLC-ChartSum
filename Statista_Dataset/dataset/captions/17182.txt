The infant mortality rate in Japan , for children under the age of one year old , was 166 deaths per thousand births in 1920 . This means that for all babies born in 1920 , just under 17 percent did survive past their first birthday . This rate decreased gradually and consistently over the next century , and today , Japan has one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world , with approximately 99.8 % of all babies surviving past their first birthday .
