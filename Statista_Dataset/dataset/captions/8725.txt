In the history of the United States , smallpox played a pivotal role in shaping the direction of the country 's development . When Europeans first arrived in the Americas , they unintentionally introduced smallpox to the continent and the disease helped to wipe out as much as 95 percent of indigenous Americans . This was one factor that allowed European settlers to colonize the continent with relative ease , although the disease remained active in the Americas until the second half of the twentieth century . The number of smallpox cases in the United States fluctuated between 1900 and 1930 , with as many as 110,000 reported cases in 1920 , however the number of cases fell sharply in the 1930s , and there were no cases at all in the United States from 1950 onwards . In 1980 , the World Health Organization declared the disease to be successfully eradicated on a global scale , making it the first infectious disease to be wiped out by intentional human activity .
