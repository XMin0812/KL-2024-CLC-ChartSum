In January 2020 , Russian president Vladimir Putin suggested to extend the maternity capital program in the country to include births of first children , for which parents would receive approximately 467 thousand Russian rubles . For the second child , the payment increased by 150 thousand Russian rubles , reaching nearly 617 thousand Russian rubles , or slightly over 10 thousand U.S. dollars as of January 2020 . The maternity benefits would increase by 150 thousand Russian rubles for each further child . The value of maternal capital benefits in Russia steadily increased since 2007 , when the state program was launched paying 250 thousand Russian rubles to mothers who gave birth to or adopted a second child . It remained stable at over 453 thousand Russian rubles from 2015 to 2019 .
