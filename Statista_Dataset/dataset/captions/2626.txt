In the U.S. many employers pay a portion of health care costs for employees . As of 2019 , the total annual medical costs for employees was just over 13 thousand U.S. dollars . That cost is expected to increase to 13.7 thousand U.S. dollars by 2020 . There have been recent changes to employer-offered health care through the Affordable Care Act that requires employers with over 50 employees to offer affordable health care options to their employees .
