In Germany , the crude birth rate in 1800 was 38 live births per thousand people , meaning that 3.8 percent of the population had been born in that year . In the nineteenth century , Germany 's crude birth rate fluctuated between 34 and 40 births per thousand people . Since the turn of the twentieth century however , the crude birth rate has been in decline , although there were a few periods where it did increase . These increases took place during periods of economic recovery , after both world wars , and after the Great Depression . The largest period of increase was after the Second World War , and lasted until the late 1960s , before decreasing to 10.3 in 1980 , where it then plateaus between eight and eleven , and it is expected to be 9.4 births per thousand people in 2020 .
