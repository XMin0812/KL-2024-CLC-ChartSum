As of December 2019 , most Italians did not know what the European Stability Mechanism was . Additionally , 25 percent had general knowledge about this European organization , while only nine percent declared to exactly know what the ESM was . The ESM is an international European organization located in Luxembourg providing financial funding for the monetary stability of the Eurozone . Its proposed reform was an object of discussion in Italian politics in the last months . The parties Lega and Fratelli d'Italia put the topic into discussion , accusing the Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of lack of transparency about the proposed reform . However , the terms of the reform were already known in December 2018 .
