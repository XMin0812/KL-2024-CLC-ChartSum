In the first half of 2019 , small cars or the B-segment made up 37.6 percent of the total car market in Italy . B-segment is a car classification defined by the European Commission as larger than cars in the A-segment and smaller than those in the C-segment . They are nippy enough for city driving and have high MPG ratings while having more space for luggage and passengers . Luxury cars ( F-segment , or full-size luxury/high-end luxury ) , on the other hand , only held 0.3 percent of the car market in Italy .
