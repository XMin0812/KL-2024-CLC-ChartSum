In 2019 , media giant WarnerMedia generated a total revenue of 33.5 billion U.S. dollars , up from 18.94 billion in the previous year . Due to the acquisition of Time Warner by AT & T and its subsequent renaming ( now WarnerMedia ) , results for previous years are not considered meaningful and as such were not reported by AT & T in 2018 or 2019 .
