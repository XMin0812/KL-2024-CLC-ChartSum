Sulfur dioxide ( SO2 ) emissions in the United States have decreased significantly over the last decades . SO2 emissions totaled 2.16 million tons in 2019 , compared to 31.22 million tons in 1970 . This reduction in SO2 is largely due to the implementation of the Acid Rain Program under the Clean Air Act through a cap and trade program for fossil-fuel powered plants .
