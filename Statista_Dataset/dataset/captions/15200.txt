This statistic shows the results of a survey question asking consumers in the UK which reasons make them less likely to buy products that are produced in an ethical way . The survey was conducted for the Department of Business , Innovation and Skills in June 2014 , with the aim to gauge public attitudes to ethical standards in retail and the impact this has on their purchase decisions . Of respondents , 39 percent share the opinion that products produced in an ethical way tend to have higher prices and would therefore deter them from buying such products . Other leading deterring factors include a lack of easily available information on ethical goods ( 33 percent ) , a lack of advertising for ethical options ( 30 percent ) and a lack of reliable information on ethical goods ( 24 percent ) .
