The fertility rate of a country is the average number of children that women from that country will have throughout their reproductive years . In the United States in 1800 , the average woman of childbearing age would have seven children over the course of their lifetime . As factors such as technology , hygiene , medicine and education improved , women were having fewer children than before , reaching just two children per woman in 1940 . This changed quite dramatically in the aftermath of the Second World War , rising sharply to over 3.5 children per woman in 1960 ( children born between 1946 and 1964 are nowadays known as the 'Baby Boomer ' generation , and they make up roughly twenty percent of todays US population ) . Due to the end of the baby boom and increased access to contraception , fertility reached it 's lowest point in the US in 1980 , where it was just 1.77 . It did however rise to over two children per woman between 1995 and 2010 , although it is expected to drop again by 2020 , to just 1.78 .
