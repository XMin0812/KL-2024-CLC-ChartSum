In the first half of 2019 , approximately 30.9 million people in the United States had no health insurance . The share of Americans without health insurance was steadily decreasing until 2015 , but has been increasing since 2017 . The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 caused this change , because it repealed the individual mandate , which penalized individuals for failing to maintain health coverage .
