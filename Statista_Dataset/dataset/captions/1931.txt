In 2018 , the Ultimate Fighting Championship ( UFC ) staged a total of 39 events . However , after a considerable drop in Pay-Per-View buy rates in 2017 , the average number of Pay-Per-View buys recovered to approximately 447 thousand per event in 2018 . One major contributor for this was UFC 229 on October 6th 2018 , featuring Khabib Nurmagomedov versus Conor McGregor , resulting in the top UFC event in terms of Pay-Per-View buys with a total of 2.4 million buys .
