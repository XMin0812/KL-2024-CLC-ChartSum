However , Hawaii had the least affordable two-bedroom apartments , as a household would have to earn at least 38.76 U.S. dollars in order to afford rent payments . These figures are considerably higher than the average minimum wage of 7.30 U.S. dollars per hour , which is in place in many states . There was no state in which a minimum wage worker could afford rent for the average two-bedroom apartment , if they only worked 40 hours a week .
