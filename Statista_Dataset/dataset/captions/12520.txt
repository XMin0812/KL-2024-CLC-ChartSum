Civil partnerships or PACS for `` Civil Solidarity Pact '' is a common practice in France . This contract does not bring the same rights and duties to the couple as a marriage contract , but it does make it possible to organize life together . Introduced in 1999 , the PACS was the first type of contract giving rights to same-sex couples . The practice has increased sharply over the first ten years , reaching more than 200,000 unions in 2010 . The practice then lost interest among the French before increasing again to reach its peak in 2018 with nearly 210,000 unions .
