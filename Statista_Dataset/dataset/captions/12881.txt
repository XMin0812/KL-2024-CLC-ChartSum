How far has gender equality progressed in Finland ? In the 2019 election , 94 of the 200 representatives in the Parliament of Finland ( in Finnish : eduskunta ) were female . This was the second highest share of women in parliaments in Europe , a ranking lead by Sweden . Finland is known for being the first country in Europe to grant women the right to vote and run for office , as well as the first to grant universal suffrage regardless of ethnicity or resources . These rights were adopted in 1906 , the same year as the Parliament of Finland was established . The third female prime minister of Finland , Sanna Marin , was instated in December 2019 . At that time , she was both the world 's youngest current state leader as well as the youngest prime minister ever in Finland .
