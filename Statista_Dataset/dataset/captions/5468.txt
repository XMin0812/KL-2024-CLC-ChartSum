The outbreak of coronavirus in the world and the occurrence of the first infected individuals in Poland may affect the economic growth of the country . At the end of 2019 , the Ministry of Finance , when preparing the strategy for 2020 - 2023 , estimated the GDP index at 3.7 percent in 2020 . After the outbreak of the coronavirus , most banks in Poland decided to revise the GDP growth forecasts . Thus , mBank assumes that GDP in 2020 will reach -4.2 percent . The largest bank in Poland , PKO BP , does not expect such a drastic decrease , predicting that the ratio will reach 3.5 percent , which is not much lower than the estimates of the Ministry of Finance in 2019 .
