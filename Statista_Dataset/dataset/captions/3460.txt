As of July 2019 , the 3D movie which had the highest lifetime gross at the North American box office was ‘ Star Wars : The Force Awakens ' with 936.66 million U.S. dollars in revenue . For years , James Cameron 's 2009 hit ‘ Avatar ' ranked second with over 760 million dollars in box office revenue . However , the movie was knocked down to third place after the success of ‘ Avengers : Endgame ' which at the time of writing had generated 842.76 million U.S. dollars in box offices in Canada and the United States – more than ‘ Captain America : Civil War ' and ‘ Iron Man 3 ' combined . The success of the final instalment in the Avengers series catapulted brothers Anthony and Joe Russo close to the top of the ranking of highest grossing directors of all time in the U.S. , overtaking Peter Jackson , Robert Zemeckis , James Cameron and Ridley Scott .
