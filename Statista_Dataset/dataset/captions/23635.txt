The coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) outbreak caused many troubles in Italy . The resilience of the Italian healthcare system and the limited capacity of hospitals were among the most pressing issues facing authorities . Conducting as many tests as possible was one of the strategies that proved effective in other countries . Italy , however , stepped up the number of COVID-19 tests conducted only at a later stage ( mid-March ) . As of May 15 , 2020 , the number of tests conducted in the country reached 2.9 million . This however , does not mean the 2.9 million individuals were tested for the virus , as generally more than one test might be needed to detect and confirm the infection .
