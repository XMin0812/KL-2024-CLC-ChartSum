In the United States , the crude birth rate in 1800 was 48.3 live births per thousand people , meaning that 4.8 percent of the population had been born in that year . Between 1815 and 1825 the crude birth rate jumped from 46.5 to 54.7 ( possibly due to Florida becoming a part of the US , but this is unclear ) , but from this point until the Second World War the crude birth rate dropped gradually , reaching 19.2 in 1935 . Through the 1940s , 50s and 60s the US experienced it 's baby boom , and the birth rate reached 24.1 in 1955 , before dropping again until 1980 . From the 1980s until today the birth rate 's decline has slowed , and is expected to reach twelve in 2020 , meaning that just over 1 percent of the population will be born in 2020 .
