This statistic shows the results of a 2016 survey among adult Americans on whether they favor or oppose laws that require transgender people to use bathrooms corresponding to their birth gender rather than their gender identity . Debate on this topic was sparked when the state of North Carolina introduced a respective law ( the so-called `` North Carolina bathroom law '' ) , causing for example corporate boycotts and even the Justice Department to weigh in and advise the state to modify the law since it violates civil rights . During this survey , 39 percent of respondents stated they strongly oppose any laws requiring transgender people to use a bathroom corresponding to their birth gender rather than their gender identity .
