In 1844 , Romania had a population of just 3.6 million people . During the early entries in this data , Romania 's borders were very different and much smaller than today , and control of this area often switched hands between the Austrian , Ottoman and Russian empires . The populations during this time are based on estimates made for incomplete census data , and they show that the population grows from 3.6 million in 1844 , doubling to 7.2 million in 1912 , part of this growth is due to a high natural birth rate during this period , but also partly due to the changing of Romania 's borders and annexation of new lands . During this time Romania gained its independence from the Ottoman Empire as a result of the Russo-Turkish War in 1878 , and experienced a period of increased stability and progress . Between 1912 and 1930 the population of Romania grew by over 10 million people . The main reason for this is the huge territories gained by Romania in the aftermath of the First World War . During the war Romania remained neutral for the first two years , after which it joined the allies ; however , it was very quickly defeated and overrun by the Central Powers , and in total it lost over 600 thousand people as a direct result of the war . With the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian and Russian empires after the war , Romania gained almost double it 's territory , which caused the population to soar to 18.1 million in 1930 . The population then decreases by 1941 and again by 1948 , as Romania seceded territory to neighboring countries and lost approximately half a million people during the Second World War . From 1948 onwards the population begins to grow again , reaching it 's peak at 23.5 million people in 1990 . Like many other Eastern European countries , there was very limited freedom of movement from Romania during the Cold War , and communist rule was difficult for the Romanian people . The Romanian Revolution in 1989 ended communist rule in the country , Romania transitioned to a free-market society and movement from the country was allowed . Since then the population has fallen each year as more and more Romanians move abroad in search of work and opportunities . The population is expected to fall to 19.2 million in 2020 , which is over 4 million fewer people than it had in 1990 .
