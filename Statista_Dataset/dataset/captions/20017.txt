The plague outbreak in Bombay around the turn of the twentieth century was the most fatal plague epidemic documented in any city in the past 130 years . Between September 1896 and May 1897 , the Municipal Hospital of Bombay reported a fatality rate in plague cases of 61.5 percent . The fatality rate among plague cases ranged between 38 and 82 percent in different months , was highest in the winter . The reason for the peak in February in Bombay is because the temperatures and climate in these months provide the optimal conditions for the breeding of rats and fleas ; in contrast to this , earlier epidemics in Europe typically peaked in Autumn , whereas the epidemics in Hong Kong between 1894 and 1902 were hardest felt in May or June .
