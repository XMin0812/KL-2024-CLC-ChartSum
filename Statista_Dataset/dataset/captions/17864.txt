The fertility rate of a country is the average number of children that women from that country will have throughout their reproductive years . In 1860 , Austria 's fertility rate was just over five children per woman , and it then declined gradually until the end of the nineteenth century . Despite a slight increase following the First world War , Austria 's fertility rate declined much faster over the next 35 years , falling below two births per woman in 1935 . There was a slight increase during the Second World War , but it then fell below two again after the war . From 1950 until the late 1970s , Austria 's fertility rate rose during the global baby boom , but since 1980 the number has remained between 1.4 and 1.7 .
