This graph shows a poll regarding the American citizens ' opinion on the `` Buffett rule '' concept brought up by Barack Obama . 52 percent of Americans say that capital gains and dividends should be taxed at the same rate as income earned from work , according to the poll . According to Wikipedia , the Buffett Rule is a tax plan proposed by President Barack Obama in 2011 to alleviate income inequality in the United States between the top 1percent of Americans and the remaining 99 percent of Americans , due to the disproportionate income growth in the 1 percent- group as compared to the 99 percent- group . The tax plan would apply to individuals earning more than 1 million U.S. dollars per year ; this comprised the top 450,000 of Americans by income when the rule was proposed . The plan is named after American investor Warren Buffett , who publicly stated in early 2011 that he disagreed with the rich paying less in federal taxes , as a portion of income , than the middle class , and has voiced support for increased taxes on the wealthy . It would implement a higher minimum tax rate for taxpayers in the highest income bracket to ensure that they do not pay a lower percentage of income in taxes than less-affluent Americans .
