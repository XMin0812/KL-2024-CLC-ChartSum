In 2019 , new homes in the United States were , on average , sold for 383,000 U.S. dollars , which is slightly down from 2018 levels . Home prices were steadily rising , after a drop between 2005 and 2011 , which corresponds with the 2007 - 2009 recession . Prices have more or less plateaued since 2017 , so the bubble which began to form in 2011 may be about to burst . Almost one third of homes in the U.S. are worth between 50,000 and 174,999 U.S. dollars , which is considerably less than the average sales price of new homes .
