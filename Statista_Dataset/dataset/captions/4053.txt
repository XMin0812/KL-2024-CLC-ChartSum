Should you carry cash in Europe ? This will highly depend on the country you are visiting . According to a Europe-wide survey from 2017 ( the only one that compared the use of paper money for in-person transactions across the continent ) , cash was used most in the southern countries of Europe , as well as in Germany , Austria and Slovenia . Only in the Netherlands and Estonia did cash money make up less than half of all payments at shops , restaurants , petrol stations and street merchants . Note that numbers for the United Kingdom ( UK ) , Denmark and Sweden were not included in this ranking ( as they were not part of the original survey ) but were added later by a different source in 2019 . This second source , however , mentions that the methodologies for UK and Sweden were `` slightly different but ( â€¦ ) broadly comparable '' . Also , it does not mention specifically whether these three `` new '' numbers were from 2016 or later ( such as 2018 or 2019 ) .
