The COVID-19 pandemic at the beginning of 2020 hit the sports industry hard . Many leagues across the globe suspended their seasons and UEFA took the unprecedented step to postpone the scheduled 2020 European Football Championship to 2021 . This move cost UEFA an estimated 300 million euros , whereas cancelling the event entirely would have cost the federation around 400 million euros .
