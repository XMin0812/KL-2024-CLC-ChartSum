This statistic shows the total mandatory excess ( in Dutch : verplicht eigen risico ) under the Dutch Health Insurance Act ( Zvw ) from 2008 to 2021 ( in euros ) . In 2021 , the total mandatory excess is to reach a value of 385 euros . In the Netherlands , every resident or employee is obliged to take a basic health insurance to cover medical costs from , for example , visits to a general practitioner or the hospital . The Dutch government decides on the cover provided by this package and health insurance companies are obliged to accept everyone who meets the requirements , regardless of age or state of health . It is compulsory , however , from the age of 18 to pay a total mandatory excess ( in Dutch : verplicht eigen risico ) before the basic insurance reimburses medical costs . This principle was introduced in the Dutch Health Insurance Act ( Zvw ) in 2008 . This mandatory excess can be increased with an additional voluntary excess ( in Dutch : vrijwillig eigen risico ) , in exchange for a lower premium . In 2017 , the average annual premium for additional health insurance reached a value of approximately 317 euros per person .
