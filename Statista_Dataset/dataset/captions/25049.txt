In the second half of the nineteenth century , the crude birth rate of Switzerland fluctuated between 27 and 32 births per thousand people , before dropping from 28.5 in 1900 , to fifteen in 1940 . After the Second World War , Switzerland experienced a baby boom , and from the 1940s until the 1970s the rate rose above it 's previous trajectory to between 17 and 19 , before dropping sharply in the 1970s . From 1980 onwards , the crude birth rate of Switzerland has remained between ten and twelve births per thousand people , and it is expected to be just 10.3 in 2020 .
