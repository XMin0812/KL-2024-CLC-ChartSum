In 2019 , the Italian footwear sector counted in total 74.9 thousand employees . This figure decreased steadily since 2015 , when the sector counted over 77 thousand employees . The decreasing number of employees was mostly due to the fact that many companies in the sector either closed down or moved abroad . In fact , the number of companies operating in the footwear industry sank in the last years , reaching 4.3 thousand in 2019 .
