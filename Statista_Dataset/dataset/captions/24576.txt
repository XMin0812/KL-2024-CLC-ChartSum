Throughout the 2018 calendar year , Shazam reportedly had 478 million annual active users , an impressive increase from the 400 million recorded in 2017 . Some sources have attributed this rapid growth to the recent acquisition of Shazam by tech giant Apple , a deal which cost Apple 400 million U.S. dollars . Apple acquired Shazam in late 2018 , a move considered controversial by some because of the effect the acquisition could have on competitors . Discussions about the acquisition began in 2017 , and it was noted that Shazam would no longer refer users to Spotify or Google Play Music and instead serve to appease Apple Music users . The acquisition was investigated by the European Commission in early 2018 but approved in September of that year .
