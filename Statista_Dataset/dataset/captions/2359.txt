The index value for Singapore was determined at 93.63 points . The Netherlands followed with a score of 89.58 points . The beginning of the current era of increasing economic globalization was signaled in by the creation of the Bretton Woods institutions towards the end of the Second World War . These institutions acted as the foundation for the International Monetary Fund , World Bank and World Trade Organization . The institutions , and their modern equivalents , sought to reduce the barriers on international trade in goods , services and capital markets . In the decades following their inception international trade has skyrocketed to become a cornerstone of the international economy , as demonstrated by trends in global export volume of trade in goods from 1950 to 2017 . Countries that are perceived as more economically globalized are those with low tariffs on imports , more free-trade agreements , regulation that accommodates foreign investment and lower non-tariff barriers to trade such as safety regulations on imports . However , economic globalization fails to capture the entire picture in regards to globalization processes and their impact on countries . As such , analysts have placed attention on the social and political effects of globalization as seen in the index for social globalization and index for political organization .
