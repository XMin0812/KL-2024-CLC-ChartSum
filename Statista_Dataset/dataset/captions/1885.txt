This statistic shows the cumulative amount of dollars pledged to project funding on Kickstarter from July 2012 to November 2020 . As of the last reported period , more than 5.43 billion U.S. dollars had been pledged to projects on the crowdfunding platform . The early 2000s saw the launch of one of the first internet crowdfunding platforms in the United States called ArtistShare . The main object of the platform was to help musicians to complete their artistic projects , such as albums or tours , with the financial help of their fans . Upon the company 's success , similar crowdfunding websites started appearing around the world . Some of the most successful crowdfunding platforms today are IndieGoGo , GoFundMe , and Fig . Kickstarter , which launched in 2009 , is one of the largest crowdfunding platforms in the world , having launched over 500,000 projects and having received pledges worth more than 5.4 billion U.S. dollars as of November 2020 . Unlike other crowdfunding companies , Kickstarter focuses on mainly creative projects , from craft ideas to music albums or technological innovations and imposes a time limit for each campaign . If the project fails to reach its funding goal , it is dropped and the pledges are returned to the backers . According to statistics released by Kickstarter , the success rate of fully funding a project on the crowdfunding website was only 37 percent . The largest number of successful campaigns has raised between 1 thousand and 9.99 thousand dollars , although a select 385 campaigns have managed to raise in excess of 1 million U.S. dollars each . Although Kickstarter does not release information on its own earnings , the company does make profits by charging a 5 percent fee to the collected funds of successful projects . However , if a campaign does not reach its goal in the estimated amount of time , no amount is charged .
