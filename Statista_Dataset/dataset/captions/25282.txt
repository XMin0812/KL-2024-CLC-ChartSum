The infant mortality rate in Russia , for children under the age of one year old , was over 266 deaths per thousand births in 1870 . This means that for all babies born in 1870 , over one quarter did not survive past their first birthday . Unfortunately some information is missing in the early twentieth century , during Russia 's revolutionary period and again during the Second World War , however it is noticeable that Russia 's infant mortality rate fell to one death for every ten babies born in 1955 , and from this point the rate has fallen to just six deaths per thousand births today .
