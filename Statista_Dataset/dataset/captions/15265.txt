The statistic shows the total attendance at games of the German football Bundesliga from the 1990/91 season to the 2019/20 season . In 2019/20 , the games of the Bundesliga were attended by a total of 9.11 million fans . This significant drop from the attendance in the previous few years can be explained by the fact that the last nine matchdays of the season were played in empty stadiums as a result of the coronavirus pandemic .
