Mobile telephones have become increasingly relevant to many aspects of modern life , a phenomenon that is evidenced by the development in the rate of households owning a mobile telephone . Currently , approximately 95 percent of households in the United Kingdom ( UK ) own a mobile phone , a figure that has remained constant since 2015 . That sits in stark contrast with 2000 - 2001 , when less than half of all households in the UK reported owning a mobile telephone .
