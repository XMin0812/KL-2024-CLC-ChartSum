This statistic shows the population of the Netherlands by religion in 2018 . This statistic shows that in 2018 roughly half of the Dutch population did not identify with any religious denomination . Of the religious population , the largest number of people ( nearly 25 percent ) identified themselves as Roman Catholics . That is particularly interesting , as the dominating church in the Netherlands since the Reformation had been the Protestant church . According to the source , approximately 15 percent of the Dutch population considered themselves a member of the three main protestant churches , the Dutch Reformed Church , the Protestant Church in the Netherlands and the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands . The category 'other ' includes not only the smaller protestant churches , but also religions that are newer to the Netherlands , such as Buddhism , Hinduism and Islam . According to this statistic , Muslims made up five percent of the population in the Netherlands .
