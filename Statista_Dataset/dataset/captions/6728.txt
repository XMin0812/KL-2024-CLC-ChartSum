The fertility rate of a country is the average number of children that women from that country will have throughout their reproductive years . From 1880 until 1970 , India 's fertility rate was very consistent , and women of this time had an average of 5.7 to six children over the course of their lifetime . In the second half of the twentieth century , the fertility rate dropped considerably , and has continued to drop in the 2000s . This decrease in the rate of fertility follows a common correlation between quality of life and fertility , where the fertility rate decreases as the standard of living improves . In 1947 , after almost a century , the Indian independence movement finally achieved its goal , and India was able to self rule . From this point onwards , Indian socio-economic improvements led to a decreased fertility rate , which is expected to fall to 2.2 in 2020 .
