The infant mortality rate in Portugal , for children under the age of one year old , was over 134 deaths per thousand births in 1910 . This means that for all babies born in 1910 , over thirteen percent did not survive past their first birthday . Over the next 25 years , the Spanish Flu pandemic and instability caused by regime changes resulted in the fluctuation of Portugal 's infant mortality rate . However , from 1935 until today , figures steadily declined , from 146 to just three deaths per thousand births .
