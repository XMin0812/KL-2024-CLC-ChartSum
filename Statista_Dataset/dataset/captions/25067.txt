ABN AMRO 's stock price , part of the AEX stock exchange in the Netherlands , decreased by almost two thirds between February and May 2020 . This was partly caused by concerns over the coronavirus outbreak , as consumer demand could decrease and industries possibly face the effects of a looming recession in 2020 . First estimates forecast that the Dutch economy , for example , could see its growth slow down significantly due to the new virus . As of January 8 , 2021 the ABN AMRO stock price was sitting at 8.96 euros - well below its level in early 2020 .
