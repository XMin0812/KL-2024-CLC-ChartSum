The fertility rate of a country is the average number of children that women from that country will have throughout their reproductive years . In 1930 , China 's fertility rate was 5.5 children per woman , and this number then dropped to just under five over the next fifteen years , as China experienced a civil war and the Second World War . The fertility rate rose rather quickly after this to over 6.1 in 1955 , before dropping again in the late 1950s , as Chairman Mao 's 'Great Leap Forward ' failed to industrialize the nation , and resulted in widespread famine that killed an estimated 45 million people . In the decade following this , China 's fertility rate reached it 's highest level in 1970 , before the implementation of the two-child policy in the 1970s , and the one-child policy   in the 1980s , which radically changed the population structure . The fertility rate fell to an all time low in the early 2000s , where it was just 1.6 children per woman . However this number has increased to 1.7 today , and the two-child policy was reintroduced in 2016 , replacing the one-child policy that had been effective for over 36 years .
