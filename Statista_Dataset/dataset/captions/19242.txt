By January 20 , 2021 , 45 men will have served as the President of the United States ( officially 46 , as Grover Cleveland served twice as the 22nd and 24th president ) . Of these 45 men , 31 have had a military background , with ranks ranging from a militia private to five star generals . There is some correlation between the ages of the presidents and major wars in U.S. history ; explaining why none of those in office between 1909 and 1945 had any military background , and why six of the ten veteran presidents since then served in the National Guard or Naval Reserve . Three US presidents have held the highest position in the U.S. military , they were ; George Washington , Commander in Chief of the Continental Army during the War of Independence , Ulysses S. Grant , Commanding General of the US Army during the American Civil War , and Dwight D. Eisenhower , Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force in Europe in the Second World War .
