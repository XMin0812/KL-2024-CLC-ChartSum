Movies based on comics and graphic novels were the most successful movies at the box office between the years 1995 and 2019 , with an average revenue of almost 99 million U.S. dollars . The enormous success of major Marvel productions like 'Avengers : Endgame ' and other films within the franchise helped to drive up the average , and with multiple more movie releases of this nature coming up in the next few years , it is fair to assume that average revenues from films inspired by comics and graphic novels will continue to grow in the future .
