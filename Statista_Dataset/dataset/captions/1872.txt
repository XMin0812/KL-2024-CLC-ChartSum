Global hotel chain Marriott International accounted for 7,349 properties worldwide in 2019 , up from 6,906 the previous year . The increase in properties from 2015 to 2016 can most likely be explained by Marriott 's acquisition of Canadian chain Delta Hotels and American chain Starwood Hotels and Resorts , in the years 2015 and 2016 , respectively . Thanks to its purchases of Delta and Starwoods , Marriott increased its presence outside of the U.S. â€“ with 1,953 properties in international locations in 2019 .
