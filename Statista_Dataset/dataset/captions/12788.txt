By April 20th 2020 , some 300,000 barrels had been cut in daily oil sands production in Canada . The coronavirus pandemic and resulting decline in consumer oil demand have been exacerbated by high levels of production in other oil producing countries and storage facilities rapidly filling up . Canada 's heavy oil benchmark Western Canadian Select has also dramatically dropped in price , trading below ten dollars per barrel for more than a week , and dropping to -0.01 U.S. dollars per barrel as of April 20 . Estimates expect production cuts in Canada may have to increase to 1.5 million barrels per day .
