About 33 percent of U.S. physicians spent 17 - 24 minutes with their patients , according to a survey conducted in 2018 . Physicians are often constrained in their time directly working with patients , which could have an impact on patient care outcomes . Studies found out that physicians spend almost half of their time in office on data entry and other desk work . More sophisticated , network-enabled EHR ( electronic health records ) systems for physicians could probably be a step towards more time directly with patients .
