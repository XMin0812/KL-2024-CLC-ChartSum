In Russia , the crude birth rate in 1840 was just over 48 live births per thousand people , meaning that approximately 4.8 percent of the population had been born in that year . Throughout the nineteenth century , Russia 's crude birth rate remained between 48 and 52 , and fell to 43.4 in the late 1920s . From 1930 to 1945 , the Soviet Union 's crude birth rate dropped greatly , from 43.4 to 18.2 , as a result of the Second World War ( although it did increase in the late 1930s , in the early stages of the war ) . Russia did experience a baby boom after the war , and the birth rate did not fall to its pre-war level gain until the late 1960s . From 1970 , the birth rate increased slightly to 16.2 in 1990 , before the end of communism and dissolution of the Soviet Union caused the crude birth rate to fall to its lowest recorded level over the next decade , to 8.9 in 2000 . Since the turn of the millennium , the crude birth rate of Russia has increased steadily , and was expected to be 12.8 in 2020 .
