In 1925 in Algeria , the average woman had 7 children during the course of her lifetime . The fertility rate of a country is the average number of children that women from that country will have throughout their reproductive years . Algeria 's fertility rate increased steadily from 1925 , until it reached 7.7 children in the 1960s , with the exception of a slight , but noticeable drop in the interval between 1950 and 1955 , which was due to the civil uprisings that eventually led to the Algerian War of Independence . From 1970 onwards , the fertility rate dropped dramatically , reaching 2.38 children per woman in 2005 . Surprisingly , after 2005 the amount started to increase again . This increase led to an average of 3 children per Algerian woman in 2020 , and it coincides with economic difficulties resulting from declining oil prices .
