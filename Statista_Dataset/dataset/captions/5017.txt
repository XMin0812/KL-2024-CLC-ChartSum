Restaurants in Ireland re-opened in June 2020 , following the coronavirus lockdown . The number of seated diners did not increase immediately , but was already above last years figures by end of the first week in July . Since October 21 , the Irish government again imposed the highest level of restrictions , causing restaurants to close for the following six weeks . As of December 20 , 2020 , the percentage of diners was 46.64 percent higher than the same day a year earlier . Measures to reduce the spread of the the coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) had a major impact on the Irish restaurant industry . In March 2020 the Irish government issued guidelines on social distancing in venues including restaurants and called on pubs and bars to close from Sunday March 15 . A day later , the year-over-year change in seated diners in restaurants on the OpenTable reservation network in Ireland was down by 70 percent , dropping further in the next days , until the government ordered all cafes and restaurants to limit their service to deliveries and takeouts by midnight on March 24 .
