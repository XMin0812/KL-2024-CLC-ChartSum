The child mortality rate in Afghanistan ( for children under the age of five ) was around 475 deaths per 1000 births during the course of 19th century . Given as a percentage , this means that 47.5 % of children born would not make it to their 5th birthday . After 1950 , the child morality rate dropped significantly due to considerable medical advancements , falling to 68 deaths per thousand in 2020 . Despite this considerable decline in recent decades , Afghanistan still has one of the highest child mortality rates in the world . Afghanistan 's infant mortality rate ( among those aged below one year ) in 2020 is 52 deaths per thousand births , meaning that the majority of child deaths occur during infancy .
