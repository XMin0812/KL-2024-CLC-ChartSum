In 2019 , the national healthcare expenditure reached a value of more than 90 billion euros , equaling a year-on-year increase of roughly five percent . In a population of over 17 million people , this came to around 6,100 euros worth of Dutch health care expenses per capita . This figure was higher than those of other European countries . The per capita health expenditure of Italy , for example , stood at slightly over 2,500 euros in 2018 , half that of the Netherlands . There are some who say , however , that this difference in health costs stems from how Dutch health insurance works .
