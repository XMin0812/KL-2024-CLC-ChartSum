Journalism may not be considered the most dangerous profession in the world , but with the number of journalists killed worldwide in 2018 amounting to a total of 80 , the risks for those entering into certain segments of the industry are clear . After 64 journalists were killed in 1995 , thankfully the number dropped sharply and remained below 40 until 2003 , before increasing again to 88 four years later . Journalist killings remained above 50 for several years , but 2019 saw the lowest number of journalists killed since 2003 . The countries where the most journalists were killed in 2019 were Syria and Mexico , with ten journalists killed in each .
