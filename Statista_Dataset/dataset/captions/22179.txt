From 1925 until 2000 the fertility rate of Afghanistan fluctuated between seven and 7.7 children per women , before dropping drastically by 2020 . The fertility rate of a country is the average number of children that women from that country will have throughout their reproductive years . Although the graph shows a constant fertility rate during the second half of the twentieth century , this is likely due to the lack of data from reliable sources , rather than a real trend . From 2000 onwards the fertility rate has dropped by more than three children per woman , and today it is 4.6 . This decline can be attributed to a reduction in infant and child mortality , and increased use of contraceptives ; usage more than doubled since 2003 , although roughly three quarters of Afghan couples still do not use any contraceptive method .
