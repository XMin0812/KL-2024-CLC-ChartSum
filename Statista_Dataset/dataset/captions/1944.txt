The monthly United Kingdom ( UK ) market share for Toyota between January 2015 and December 2020 fluctuated substantially . Brand market share in the UK was disrupted in 2018 in the face of new diesel emission regulations and again in 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic . Temporary changes in market share in such times affect all vehicle marques but in different ways . The highest market share for Toyota was recorded in June 2020 , at around eight percent . This is likely due to a rebound effect from Toyota 's low market share in April and May . In April 2020 , the brand sold around 20 new vehicles in the UK . Overall , figures for the first nine months of 2020 had not fallen as poorly as competitors . By the end of December 2020 , Toyota 's market share had grown compared to 2020 .
