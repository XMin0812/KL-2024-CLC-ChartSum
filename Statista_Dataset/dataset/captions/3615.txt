The average house rent price in the Netherlands reached a value of nearly 17 euros per square meter in the second quarter of 2020 . This was an increase of 2.4 percent compared to the previous year , an increase the source describes as `` rather moderate '' . This because housing prices tended to increase at much higher rates in 2019 . Note that the numbers shown in this statistic are not from a governmental institution , but concern rental housing being offered on the website of the source in the specific quarters . This implies the numbers only show rents of property on the free market and excludes social housing . No difference was made between the type of rental housing , such as houses , apartments , rooms or studios .
