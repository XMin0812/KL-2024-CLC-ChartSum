Including President-elect Joe Biden , the United States has had 46 presidents since George Washington 's election in 1789 . While Washington himself was not affiliated with any political party , and even argued against partisanship ( something that the other Founding Fathers agreed with ) , political differences and personal rivalries between the Founding Fathers eventually led to the founding of the Federalist Party , led by Alexander Hamilton , and the Democratic-Republican Party , led by Thomas Jefferson . Washington 's successor , John Adams , was the only Federalist president , before the Democratic-Republicans occupied the White House from 1801 until 1829 .
