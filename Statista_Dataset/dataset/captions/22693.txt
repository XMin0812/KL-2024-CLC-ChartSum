In China , the crude birth rate in 1930 was just under 39 live births per thousand people , meaning that 3.9 percent of the population had been born in that year . The crude birth rate dropped gradually over the next fifteen years , however it then rose to it 's highest recorded figure by 1955 . Between 1945 and 1950 , the Second World War ended and the Chinese Civil War was finally coming to an end , and during this time the crude birth rate rose to almost 47 births per thousand in individual years . The crude birth rate dropped again in the late 1950s , as Chairman Mao 's 'Great Leap Forward ' failed to industrialize the nation , and resulted in a famine which killed an estimated 45 million people . The 1960s saw some recovery , where the figures rose from 36.4 to 39.5 births per thousand in this decade , however two-child and one-child policies were introduced in the 1970s and 80s , in an attempt to slow China 's rapidly growing population . These measures led to the decline of the birth rate , dropping below fifteen births per thousand at the turn of the millennium . From 2000 until now the decline of China 's crude birth rate has slowed , falling by just 2.8 births per thousand over the past twenty years , and it is expected to be just below twelve in 2020 .
