The COVID-19 pandemic that spread across the world at the beginning of 2020 was not only a big threat to public health , but also to the entire entertainment industry . While cinemas and theaters closed their doors to try to stem the spread of the disease , many people turned to home entertainment during periods of self-isolation . From March 16 to March 22 , a total of 1.58 million physical game titles were sold worldwide . This 82 percent total increase from the previous week is , in part , due to the release of new titles Animal Crossing : New Horizons and DOOM : Eternal . However , even when sales of these two games are deducted , physical game sales were still 10.8 percent higher than the previous week , suggesting that many people were turning to video gaming to keep them entertained through the crisis .
