This statistic shows the results of a survey among adults in the Ukraine on what they think the future status of Crimea , or the Crimean Peninsula , should be . The survey was conducted in March 2014 in light of the civil unrest and demonstrations in Ukraine over joining the European Union or forming a union with Russia , as protesters did not want Ukraine to form closer bonds with Russia . During these disputes , Crimea became the subject of territorial quarrels between Ukraine and Russia . During this survey , 50 percent of respondents in Ukraine said they think Crimea should be an autonomous republic within Ukraine .
