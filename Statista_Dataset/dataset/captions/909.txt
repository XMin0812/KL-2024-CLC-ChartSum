This statistic illustrates the market share of the current accounts of leading banks in the United Kingdom ( UK ) as of 2014 . Market share of current accounts is an important measure for comparison between banks , as a larger share of the current account market means that more customers are actively keeping their money with a particular bank . Furthermore , current account market share is important for the banks themselves as an increase in the market share of current accounts will lead to an increase in revenue , as all accounts , no matter the type , have a form of revenue associated with them . It can be seen that as of 2014 , the London headquartered Lloyds Bank PLC had the largest share of the current accounts market . A total of more than one quarter ( 27 percent ) of all current accounts were with Lloyds Bank PLC at that time . With a share of almost one fifth ( 18 percent ) of the current accounts market each , Barclays Bank PLC and the Royal Bank of Scotland were joint second at that time . Since the introduction of `` current account switch service '' ( CASS ) by Payments Council , the gains and loses on the current accounts market by the leading banks have been closely monitored .
