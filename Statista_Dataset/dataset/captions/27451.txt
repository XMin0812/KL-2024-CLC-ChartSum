In Norway , the crude birth rate in 1800 was thirty live births per thousand people , meaning that three percent of the population had been born in that year . In the nineteenth century , Norway 's crude birth rate generally fluctuated between 27 and 34 births per thousand people , during a time of war , independence and industrialization . From the turn of the twentieth century until 1935 , the crude birth rate dropped from just under thirty in 1900 , to 15.2 in 1935 . During and after the Second World War , Norway experienced a baby boom , where the rate increased to over twenty children per thousand people in the late 1940s , and it did not fall back to it 's pre-war level until the late 1970s . From 1980 onwards , the crude birth rate of Norway remained between eleven and fourteen , and in 2020 it is expected to fall to it 's lowest level of 11.1 births per thousand people .
