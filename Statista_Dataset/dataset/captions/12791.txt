In 2019 , there were 559 drive-in cinema screens in the United States , down from 638 a decade earlier . Whilst drive-in cinemas have waned in popularity , there is potential for this to change . The coronavirus pandemic meant that cinemas all over the world closed their doors to moviegoers for several months , but as of mid-2020 there has been a small resurgence in outdoor drive-in cinema sites and screens to enable customers to enjoy movies from the safety of their own vehicle without mixing with others . If customers continue to feel uncomfortable in public spaces and the threat of the virus continues for longer than aniticpated , it is possible that drive-in movie-viewing will become the natural preference for many movie fans .
