The child mortality rate in Canada , for children under the age of five , was 333 deaths per thousand births in the year 1830 . This means that one third of all children born in 1830 did not make it to their fifth birthday . Child mortality remained above 25 percent for the remainder of the nineteenth century , before falling at a much faster rate throughout the 1900s . By the year 2020 , Canada 's child mortality rate is expected to be just five deaths per thousand births .
