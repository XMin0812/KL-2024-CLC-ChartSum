In 2019 , the total health expenditure made up around 13 percent of total GDP in the Netherlands . This is probably due to the health insurance system . In the Netherlands , every resident or employee is obliged to take a basic health insurance to cover medical costs from , for example , visits to a general practitioner or the hospital . The Dutch government decides on the cover provided by this package and health insurance companies are obliged to accept everyone who meets the requirements , regardless of age or state of health . An important characteristic of Dutch health insurance , though , is the so-called `` principle of social solidarity '' : the overall costs of health care are paid by everybody . It is since 2008 , for example , compulsory from the age of 18 to pay a total mandatory excess before the basic health insurance reimburses medical costs . In this way , everybody contributes to certain types of healthcare such as maternity care . In 2020 , the total mandatory excess reached a value of 385 euros .
