The death rate from coal energy was one of the highest in the world at an estimated 100,000 deaths per terawatt hour , in terms of human and environmental costs . This death rate is based on mining extraction operations as well as the actual use of energy . Air pollution from coal-fired plants has also been of growing concern as it has been linked to asthma , cancer , and heart disease . Burning coal can release toxic airborne pollutants such as mercury , sulfur dioxide , nitrogen oxides , and particulate matter . China is still one of the biggest consumers of coal energy with the highest installed capacity of coal plants in the world . The number of fatalities due to air pollution has reached over 2.5 million in the East Asia and Pacific region as of 1990 .
