In India , the crude birth rate in 1880 was 41.5 live births per thousand people , meaning that approximately 4.2 percent of the population had been born in that year . After an initial jump from 40.9 to 46.5 births per thousand between 1885 and 1890 , India 's crude birth rate remained consistent at just over 45 until the middle of the twentieth century . It was during the late 1940s that India gained its independence from the British Empire , and from this point the crude birth rate has gradually decreased from over 45 births per thousand people in 1945 , to below twenty today . In 2020 , it is expected to be just 18 births per thousand .
