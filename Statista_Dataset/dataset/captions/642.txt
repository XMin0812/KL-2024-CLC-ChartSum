In baseball terms , a home run is a hit that allows the batter to run all the way around the bases and reach home safely . Home runs are generally achieved when the ball is hit over the outfield without touching the ground first . In Major League Baseball , Barry Bonds leads the pack of all-time home run scorers . He hit a record 762 home runs in his career between 1986 and 2007 , during which time he played for the Pittsburgh Pirates and the San Francisco Giants .
