This statistic shows the total annual expenditure on furniture and furnishings in the United Kingdom from 2005 to 2019 , based on volume . In 2019 , UK households purchased approximately 17 billion British pounds worth of furniture and furnishings , an increase on the previous year of roughly one and a half billion British pounds . According to results of the 2020 Statista Global Consumer survey , 21 percent of UK consumers have bought furniture and household goods online in the last 12 months , while 32 percent claim to mostly look online for information about these products . Over the past seven years there has been a decline in the number of furniture manufacturing enterprises in the United Kingdom , but since 2015 , numbers have been picking up again . It seems now that the United Kingdom is importing its furniture from outside of the European Union instead of manufacturing it dometically , with imports reaching 3.7 billion British pounds in 2018 . This number has significantly increased since 2003 , where only 1.79 billion British pounds worth of furniture goods were imported from non-European countries .
