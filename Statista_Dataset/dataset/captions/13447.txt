In France , the crude birth rate in 1800 was 29.4 live births per thousand people , meaning that 2.9 percent of the population had been born in that year . In the first half of the nineteenth century France 's crude birth rate dropped from it 's highest recorded level of 29.4 in 1800 , to 21.9 by 1850 . In the second half of the 1800s the crude birth rate rose again , to 25.5 in 1875 , as the Second Republic and Second Empire were established , which was a time of economic prosperity and the modernization of the country . From then until 1910 there was a gradual decline , until the First World War caused a huge decline , resulting in a record low crude birth rate of 13.3 by 1920 ( the figures for individual years fell even lower than this ) . The figure then bounced back in the early 1920s , before then falling again until the Second World War . After the war , France experienced a baby boom , where the crude birth rate reached 22.2 , before it dropped again until the 1980s , and since then it has declined slowly . The crude birth rate of France is expected to reach a new , record low of 11.2 in 2020 .
