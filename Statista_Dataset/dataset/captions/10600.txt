Life expectancy in France was below thirty in the late 1700s , but over the course of the next two and a half centuries it is expected to reach 82.5 by the year 2020 . Although life expectancy has generally increased throughout France 's history , there were several times where the rate deviated from its previous trajectory . The most noticeable changes were because of smallpox and influenza epidemics in the 1700s , medical advancements ( such as vaccination and pasteurization ) saw life expectancy increase in the 1800s , and then both World Wars and the epidemics that followed caused brief drops in the first half of the twentieth century .
