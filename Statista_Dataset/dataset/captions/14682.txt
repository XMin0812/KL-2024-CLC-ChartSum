The COVID-19 pandemic at the beginning of 2020 hit the sports industry hard . Many professional leagues across the globe suspended their seasons , while Major League Soccer postponed the start of its new season for 30 days in light of the pandemic . This jeopardized the league 's media rights deal , which brings in annual revenues of an estimated 90 million U.S. dollars . Teams in the USL Championship , the league below the MLS , are also set to be hit hard by the postponement , with the top teams in the league missing out on potential revenue of over 200 thousand U.S. dollars per home game .
