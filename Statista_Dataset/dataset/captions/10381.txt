By simply looking at the graph we can see that the population of the world grew by less in the first 11,900 years , than it has in the past fifty years . As we can see , growth until the year 1900 was very slow and steady compared to now , only reaching the first 100 million somewhere in the second millennium BCE , and the first billion in the early nineteenth century . To put that into perspective , the population grew by roughly one billion people every twelve years , between 1975 and 2011 ( reaching four , five and six billion at each interval ) .
