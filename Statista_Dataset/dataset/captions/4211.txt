According to a survey conducted from 2019 to 2020 , nearly 13 percent of Italians respondents know a victim of revenge porn . Revenge porn is the act of sharing private sexual images or videos of a person without his/her consent , usually in an attempt to harm or punish him or her . Such pictures or videos are generally shared on specific platforms or closed groups on social media , yet can also be sent through regular texting apps . The psychological harm of such a violation can be devastating for the victim and even push the person to commit suicide .
