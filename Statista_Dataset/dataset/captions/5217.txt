In December 2019 , Bentley sold 186 vehicles in the United Kingdom market . Sales of the British luxury car usually peaked in March and September of each year , as those were the months when the Driver & Vehicle Licensing Agency ( DVLA ) issued new registration plates . September 2018 was the notable exception , as there had only been 52 sales recorded . Bentley has been producing cars since 1919 and became a subsidiary of Volkswagen in 1998 .
