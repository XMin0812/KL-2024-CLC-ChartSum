This statistic shows the number of car thefts per 10 thousand registered cars according to the model of the car in Great Britain in 2011 and 2012 . The Mitsubishi Pajero was the car model with the highest theft rate in Great Britain , however , this is the imported model of what is sold as the Mitsubishi Shogun in Britain . Since it is not built for Britain , the security features do not meet the more stringent UK laws hence it is easier to steal .
