In October 2020 , there were just under 46.3 thousand deaths in England and Wales , compared with 42.5 thousand in the previous month . Earlier in this year , there were more than 88 thousand deaths registered in April , which was an increase of almost 40 thousand on the month before , and by far the month with the most deaths in this five year period . The dramatic increase in deaths in April can be attributed to the Coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) pandemic , which first hit the UK in early 2020 .
