While old rivals Liverpool FC may have run off with the Premier League trophy , it was Manchester United who topped the average attendance table in the 2019/2020 season . An average of 57,942 watched every home match at Old Trafford , meaning that the Red Devils more or less sold out the stadium for every one of the Premier League home games . This figure is skewed by the fact that the final 92 fixtures of the Premier League season were played behind closed doors as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 .
