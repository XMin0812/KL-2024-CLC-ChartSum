The child mortality rate in Australia , for children under the age of five , was 391 deaths per thousand births in 1860 . This means that just under forty percent of all children born in 1860 did not make it to their fifth birthday . This number dropped drastically over the next ten years , then it remained between 150 and two hundred for the remainder of the 1800s , before dropping consistently from 1900 until today . By 2020 , child mortality in Australia is expected to be approximately four deaths per thousand births .
