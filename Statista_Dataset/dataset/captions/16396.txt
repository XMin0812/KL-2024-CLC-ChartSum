The fertility rate of a country is the average number of children that women from that country will have throughout their reproductive years . In the second half of the nineteenth century in Spain , the fertility rate fluctuated , but overall it had decreased from 5.1 children per woman in 1850 to 4.7 in 1905 . From 1905 until 1935 the fertility decline followed a steady trajectory , falling from 4.7 to 3.5 births per woman during this time . Between 1935 and 1940 , the Spanish Civil War caused the fertility rate to drop by 0.7 children per woman . The rate dropped again in the 1940s and 50s , before Spain experienced a baby boom , much like the rest of Western Europe , in the mid 1900s . Compared with the rest of Europe , Spain 's baby boom was relatively small , although the population did not begin to decrease again until the late 1970s . Spain had one of the lowest fertility rates in the world at the end of the 1900s , and at the beginning of the twenty-first century , the fertility rate was at it 's lowest point ever , reaching just 1.2 children per woman in 2000 . This number has increased slightly in the past two decades , and is expected to be just over 1.3 in 2020 .
