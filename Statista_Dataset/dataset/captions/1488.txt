This statistic displays the annual exchange rate ( average or standardized measure ) of the euro to the Polish zloty ( EUR PLN ) , according to data from the European Central Bank , from the introduction of the euro in 1999 to 2019 . The average , or standardized , measure shows the calculation based on many observations throughout the period in question , which is different than an annual measure at point in time : this denotes concrete values as of the end of the year . Between the years of 2001 and 2004 , the average annual exchange rate of the euro to the Polish zloty noted a steep increase . In 2004 , the euro to Polish zloty annual average exchange rate was equal to 4.53 , which meant that one euro could buy 4.53 Polish zloty . It dipped at the height of global recession , in 2008 . Between 2010 and 2016 the value increased overall , to 4.36 which meant that one euro could buy 4.36 Polish zloty before falling once again in 2019 to 4.3 Polish zloty . This overall increase in an average annual euro to Polish zloty exchange rate is also reflected in the monthly exchange rate in recent years , although in this case the values are measured at one point in time ( end of month ) .
