This statistic shows the number of households in Belgium in 2020 , by type . In 2020 approximately five million private households were counted in Belgium , of which approximately 35 percent or 1.7 million were single-person households . Approximately one million households consisted of married couples with children living at home , whereas another 951,000 married couples had no children living at home . Relatively few households consisted of unmarried couples without children living at home . As this statistic shows , the number of households in Belgium is constantly increasing , from 4.7 million in 2011 to nearly five million according to the most recent numbers . This number is therefore expected to slowly increase further in the near future , with ever more single-person households forming in Belgium . Because of the ageing population , the number of collective households could also increase in the future .
