In the second quarter of 2020 , JPMorgan Chase was the largest bank in the United States by assets and had a common equity tier 1 ( CET1 ) capital ratio of 12.38 percent , which was above the required level of 4.5 percent . However , the sixth largest bank , Morgan Stanley , had the highest CET1 ratio at 16.54 percent . This requirement is mandated under Basel III , which is an internationally agreed upon set of measures created by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to ensure stability in the global banking sector . All banks and other financial institutions must set aside enough capital to cover unexpected losses and remain solvent in a crisis . They should hold enough capital to equal at least eight percent of risk-weighted assets and the highest quality capital - common equity tier 1 - should make up at least 4.5 percent of risk-weighted assets . These measures were developed in response to the financial crisis of 2007 - 2009 . JPMorgan Chase had the highest level of tier 1 capital among all banks in the United States in 2019 .
