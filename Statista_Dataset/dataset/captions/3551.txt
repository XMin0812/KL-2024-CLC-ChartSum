The total direct position of the U.S. abroad amounted to 5.95 trillion U.S. dollars in that year . U.S. direct investment abroad is defined as ownership by a U.S. investor of at least 10 percent of a foreign business . The direct investor is known as a U.S. parent , and the U.S.-owned foreign business is known as a foreign affiliate . International transactions statistics cover the foreign affiliates ' transactions with their U.S. parents , so these statistics focus on the U.S. parent 's share , or interest , in its affiliates rather than on the affiliates ' overall size or level of operations . The major items include capital flows , which measure the funds that U.S. parents provide to their foreign affiliates , and income , which measures the return on those funds . Direct investment position statistics are stocks and are cumulative ; they measure the total outstanding level of U.S. direct investment abroad at year end .
