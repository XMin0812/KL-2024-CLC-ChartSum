The Chief Medical Officer defines an active person as someone who , over the course of a week , achieves a total of at least 150 moderate intensity equivalent minutes of physical activity . Any vigorous activity counts for double , so each vigorous minute of physical activity counts as two moderate minutes of physical activity , where moderate activity is defined as activity where you raise your heart rate and feel a little out of breath and vigorous activity is defined as activity that causes you to breathe hard and fast , resulting in a significantly increased heart rate . Following these definitions people can be categorised as ‘ Active ' if they achieve at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity equivalent minutes of physical activity per week ; ‘ Fairly active ' if they achieve between 30 - 149 minutes ; and ‘ Inactive ' if they achieve fewer than 30 minutes of physical activity per week . The duration of physical activity is considered if achieved in one session or from sessions of at least 10 minutes across different days through a combination of physical activities .
