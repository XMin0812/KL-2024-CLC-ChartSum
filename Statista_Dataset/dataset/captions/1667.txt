In 2019 , over 66 percent of South Africa 's total population lived in urban areas and cities . Urbanization defines the share of urban population from the total population of a country . Just like urbanization , the population density within the nation has risen , reaching 46 inhabitants per square kilometer , meaning more people are sharing less space . Many opportunities for work and leisure can be found in the urban locations of South Africa , and as such the five largest municipalities each now have over three million residents .
