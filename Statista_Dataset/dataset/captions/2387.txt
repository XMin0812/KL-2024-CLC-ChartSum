In the final quarter of 2020 , the Walt Disney Company reported a net loss of 0.71 billion U.S. dollars , marking a significant recovery from the net loss of 4.72 billion in the previous quarter of the fiscal year . The company noted that net income for most of 2020 was adversely affected by the coronavirus pandemic . Disney 's quarterly revenue remained strong in Q2 2020 which the company partially attributed to the success of its new streaming service Disney+ , and whilst Disney+ continued to perform well in the third quarter of 2020 , revenue in general fell . The Walt Disney Company 's poor financial results for Q3 and Q4 2020 can be attributed to the coronavirus outbreak , which forced closures of all parks for the entire third quarter , and prevented cruise ship sailings .
