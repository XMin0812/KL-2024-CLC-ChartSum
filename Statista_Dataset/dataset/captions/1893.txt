Facebook , the world 's most popular social network , has billions of monthly active users globally of which less than three million are in China . The reason why Facebook reaches only around four percent of the Chinese population is because it is blocked in mainland China ( excluding Hong Kong , Macau , and Taiwan ) along with many other foreign social media giants like YouTube , Instagram , Pinterest and Twitter .
