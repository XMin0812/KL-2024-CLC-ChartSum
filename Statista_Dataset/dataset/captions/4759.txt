After closing for two months due to the coronavirus pandemic , restaurants in parts of Germany began to re-open in May 2020 . The number of seated diners was much lower in the initial weeks compared to last year , but the figures , based on an analysis of online , phone and walk-in reservations , generally rose in the following months . As of November 2 , a new partial lockdown started in Germany , causing restaurants to close for visitors initially until December , with even tougher restrictions extended into January . On December 20 , 2020 , there were around 97.79 percent less seated diners in German restaurants than on the same day a year ago . Measures to reduce the spread of the the coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) in Germany had a major impact on the local restaurant industry . On March 16 , 2020 the federal government together with federal states , announced new regulations that required restaurants to close daily by 6pm and to implement distancing between tables or to limit guests . On the day of the implementation , the year-over-year decline in seated diners in restaurants on the online reservation service OpenTable went down by a staggering 90 percent . Only a short time later most states had ordered all restaurants to close to guests , but still allowed them sell to customers if they ordered as a take out or delivery .
