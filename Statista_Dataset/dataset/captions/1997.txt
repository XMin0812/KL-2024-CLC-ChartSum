In 2020 there were over 145 thousand personnel serving in the British Armed Forces , the second-fewest of any year since 1900 , with just 144 thousand serving in 2019 . In the first half of the twentieth century , there are two huge spikes in the number of personnel which represent the final years of World War One and World War Two , with the British Armed Forces numbering 4.58 million and 4.69 million in 1918 and 1945 respectively . Ever since 1945 the size of the UK Armed Forces has been in almost constant decline , with the noticeable exception of the early 1950s , where Britain 's armed forces increased by almost 200 thousand because of the Korean War .
