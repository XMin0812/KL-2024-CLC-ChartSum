This statistic displays a comparison of the number of discovered genes with known phenotypes or disease-causing mutations in 2003 and 2015 . In 2003 only 1,474 genes were identified that had mutations that cause disease , while in 2015 , 2,937 genes had been identified with mutations that cause diseases . Since the completion of the human genome project in 2003 , gene identification technology has advanced and more phenotypes and disease-causing mutations have been found .
