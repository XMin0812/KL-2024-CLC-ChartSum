This statistic shows the monthly percentage of change in the Producer Price Index for intermediate goods in the United States . The category of intermediate materials , supplies , and components consists partly of commodities that have been processed but require further processing , for example such semifinished goods as flour or lumber . The intermediate goods category also encompasses nondurable , physically complete items purchased by business firms as inputs for their operations , for example diesel fuel or paper boxes . The Producer Price Index ( PPI ) program measures the average change over time in the selling prices received by domestic producers for their output . The prices included in the PPI are from the first commercial transaction for many products and some services . In December 2013 , the PPI for intermediate goods decreased by 0.6 percent compared to December 2012 .
