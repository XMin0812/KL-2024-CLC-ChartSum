The Intel Extreme Masters ( IEM ) is a series of eSports events held across the world . One of the games played is the series in Counter Strike : Global Offensive , the final rounds of which were played in Katowice , Poland in 2020 . The pinnacle of the CS : GO tournament , the final between G2 and NaVi , was watched by a peak audience of over one million viewers . This peak viewer count is no doubt in part due to the coronavirus pandemic which spread across the world at the beginning of 2020 . As millions of people were encouraged and , in some cases , legally required to stay at home , many people turned to video gaming and eSports as a form of entertainment .
