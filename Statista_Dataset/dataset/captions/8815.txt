In 2019 , the domestic box office revenue of Universal was pegged at approximately 1.3 billion U.S. dollars , the lowest recorded for several years . The studio 's adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber 's 'Cats ' failed to reach expectations when it came to its box office revenue and was poorly received by critics , and whilst highly praised thriller 'Us ' performed well in both regards and was Universal 's highest grossing movie in 2019 , its 175 million U.S. dollars in box office revenue paled in comparison to the 417 million pulled in by 'Jurassic World : Fallen Kingdom ' a year earlier .
