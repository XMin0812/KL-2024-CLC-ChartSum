Public spending on police services in the United Kingdom rose to 18.02 billion British pounds in 2019/20 , the highest amount spent since 2011/12 when police spending was 18.24 billion pounds . Between 2009/10 and 2013/14 the amount of public money spent on the police fell from 19.3 billion pounds to just 16.35 billion pounds , due to the austerity policies followed by the UK government at the time .
