In the second week of April 2020 , toilet paper sales in Russia decreased by 20 percent compared to the same period in the previous year . This could be explained by panic buying by Russians due to the coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) outbreak . Preparing for a potential isolation due to the pandemic , Russians stocked up on sugar , buckwheat , and other foods with a long shelf life in March 2020 , so the sales growth of these categories in April 2020 decreased .
