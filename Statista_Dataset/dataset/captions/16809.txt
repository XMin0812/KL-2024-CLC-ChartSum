The fertility rate of a country is the average number of children that women from that country will have throughout their reproductive years . From 1800 to 1875 , Sweden 's fertility rate fluctuated quite regularly , rising from 4.1 children per woman in 1800 to it 's maximum recorded figure of 5.1 in the early 1820s , and then dropping to 4.2 by 1870 . It was at this point that the fertility rate began falling gradually , to just 1.7 births per woman in 1935 . Sweden also experienced its own baby boom that lasted from the 1940s to the late 1960s , before falling to 1.6 in 1985 . In the past few decades , Sweden 's fertility rate has again fluctuated between 1.5 and 2 children per woman , due to varying economic circumstances and migrational factors . In 2020 , it is estimated that the fertility rate of Sweden will be 1.9 children per woman .
