    "\n",
    "[Vaswani et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) introduced the world to transformer neural networks (originally for machine translation). Transformers ushered an era of generative AI with diffusion models for image creation and large language models (`LLMs`) as **programmable deep learning networks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming foundational LLMs is done with natural language – it doesn't require training/tuning like ML models of the past. This has opened the door to a massive amount of innovation and a paradigm shift in how technology can be deployed. The science/art of using natural language to program language models to accomplish a task is referred to as **Prompt Engineering**."

    "1. **Cloud hosting**: Using a cloud provider to deploy an instance that hosts a specific model. Ex. running Llama 2 on cloud providers like AWS, Azure, GCP, and others.\n",
    "    * Best for customizing models and their runtime (ex. fine-tuning a model for your use case).\n",
    "1. **Hosted API**: Call LLMs directly via an API. There are many companies that provide Llama 2 inference APIs including AWS Bedrock, Replicate, Anyscale, Together and others.\n",

By using the `[INST][/INST]` tags, the model may have more consistent and accurate response over the longer conversations, and you will not run the risk of the tags being included in the response. \n",

      "Sure, I'd be happy to help! Large language models have been a rapidly evolving field in natural language processing (NLP) over the past few years, and there have been many exciting advances. Here are some of the latest developments:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Transformers: The transformer architecture, introduced in 2017, revolutionized the field of NLP by providing a new way of processing sequential data. Transformers are based on attention mechanisms that allow the model to focus on specific parts of the input sequence, rather than considering the entire sequence at once. This has led to significant improvements in tasks such as machine translation and text classification.\n",
      "2. BERT and its variants: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a pre-trained language model that has achieved state-of-the-art results on a wide range of NLP tasks. BERT uses a multi-layer bidirectional transformer encoder to generate contextualized representations of words in a sentence. These representations can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, such as sentiment analysis or question answering. BERT has been widely adopted in industry and academia, and has led to the development of variants such as RoBERTa and DistilBERT.\n",
      "3. Long-range dependencies: One of the challenges of large language models is that they can struggle to capture long-range dependencies, or relationships between words that are far apart in a sentence. Recent advances have focused on addressing this issue, such as the use of \"long-range dependence\" techniques that allow the model to consider the entire input sequence when generating each output element.\n",
      "4. Multitask learning: Another recent trend in large language models is the use of multitask learning, where the model is trained on multiple tasks simultaneously. This can help the model learn more efficiently and improve its performance on each task. For example, a model might be trained on both language translation and language generation tasks, allowing it to learn shared representations across the two tasks.\n",
      "5. Efficiency improvements: Finally, there has been a focus on improving the efficiency of large language models, so that they can be deployed in more resource-\n",

      "\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Easy to learn: PyTorch has a Pythonic API and is relatively easy to learn, especially for those with prior experience in Python.\n",
      "2. Dynamic computation graph: PyTorch's computation graph is dynamic, which means that it can be built and modified at runtime. This allows for more flexibility in the design of machine learning models.\n",
      "3. Autograd: PyTorch's autograd system automatically computes gradients, which makes it easier to implement backpropagation and optimize machine learning models.\n",
      "4. Support for distributed training: PyTorch provides built-in support for distributed training, which allows for faster training of large models on multiple GPUs or machines.\n",
      "5. Extensive community: PyTorch has a large and active community of developers and users, which means that there are many resources available for learning and troubleshooting.\n",
      "6. Support for a wide range of devices: PyTorch supports a wide range of devices, including CPUs, GPUs, and specialized hardware like TPUs and RTX 3090.\n",
      "7. Flexible pre-training: PyTorch provides a flexible pre-training framework that allows for easy fine-tuning of pre-trained models.\n",
      "8. Efficient memory management: PyTorch has efficient memory management, which means that it can handle large models and datasets without running out of memory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Steep learning curve: While PyTorch is easy to learn for those with prior experience in Python, it can be challenging for those without prior experience in machine learning or Python.\n",
      "2. Limited support for certain algorithms: PyTorch may not have support for certain machine learning algorithms or techniques, which can limit its use in certain applications.\n",
      "3. Limited support for certain data types: PyTorch may not have support for certain data types, such as categorical data or time-series data, which can limit its use in certain applications.\n",

      "\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Flexibility**: PyTorch is highly flexible and allows for easy experimentation with different architectures and hyperparameters. Its dynamic computation graph and modular architecture make it easy to build and modify models on the fly.\n",
      "2. **Ease of use**: PyTorch has a Pythonic API and is relatively easy to learn, especially for developers with prior experience in Python. It also provides a rich set of pre-built components and tools, such as tensor manipulation and visualization, that simplify the development process.\n",
      "3. **High-performance**: PyTorch is highly optimized for performance, with fast computation and memory allocation. It also supports GPU acceleration and distributed training, making it suitable for large-scale deep learning tasks.\n",
      "4. **Tensor computation**: PyTorch provides a powerful tensor computation engine that allows for efficient and flexible computation of complex mathematical operations. This makes it particularly useful for tasks that require complex tensor manipulation, such as computer vision and natural language processing.\n",
      "5. **Autograd**: PyTorch's autograd system provides automatic differentiation, which is useful for training and debugging deep learning models. It also allows for efficient computation of gradients, which is essential for optimization and model improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Steep learning curve**: While PyTorch is relatively easy to learn for developers with prior experience in Python, it can be challenging for those without a strong background in deep learning or Python. The framework's flexibility and power can also make it overwhelming for beginners.\n",
      "2. **Lack of documentation**: PyTorch's documentation is not as comprehensive as some other deep learning frameworks, which can make it difficult to find the information you need. However, the community is active and provides many resources, such as tutorials and forums, to help users learn and use the framework.\n",
      "3. **Limited support for certain tasks**: While PyTorch is highly versatile and can be used for a wide range of deep learning tasks, it may not be the best choice for certain specific tasks, such as reinforcement learning or time-series analysis. In these cases, other frameworks like TensorFlow or Keras\n",
