In Belgium, the first peak of daily positive coronavirus cases reached 2,336 in April, while the second peak reached 22,210 in October. Thus, confirmed coronavirus cases during the second wave were ten times higher than during the first wave. However, cases have since then decreased, which could indicate that Belgium managed to control the second wave. Nonetheless, roughly 625,930 people have been tested positive for the coronavirus in the country, to this day. According to the number of cases per region, Wallonia was the most severely affected by the virus."

In 2015, the maximum total annualized cost of cyber crime committed against U.S. companies amounted to 65.05 million U.S. dollars.  Cyber crimes refer to online attacks targeting groups, individuals or companies through means of computer and networks. Cyber attacks can target computers directly or have primary targets independent of the computer network. Cyber attacks generate significant costs for the victims, ranging from data loss to financial costs through data recovery, preventive measures such as investigation, forensics and reputation management, as well as data investments in new technology.  Common cyber attacks targeting computers include various incarnations of cyber terrorism through denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, computer viruses and malware. Attacks using computers as a means to carry out other forms of malicious online activity include phishing, espionage, fraud or identity theft, as well as cyber warfare. The costs of cyber crime are calculated by the direct and indirect expenses incurred by the victims. The four main cost-centers are detection and discovery, escalation, notification and finally, ex-post response. Cyber attacks also damage companies\u00e2\u20ac?reputations and diminish the confidence of current and future customers, resulting in lower turnover and customer acquisition rates."

    "summary": "The statistic depicts the market value of the largest internet companies worldwide as of June 2019. That year, e-commerce company Amazon's market value was 888 billion U.S. dollars. Alphabet, the parent company of search market leader Google, had a market value of 741 billion U.S. dollars.  The end of the 1990 in the United States saw the rise of a great number of internet companies, also called online companies or a variety of the name \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dot com,\u00e2\u20ac?where the \u00e2\u20ac?com\u00e2\u20ac?domain is derived from the word commercial. At the time, such startups were merely riding the wave of early internet business, but had little capital and perhaps one good idea. Few companies have survived the burst of the dot com bubble and even fewer have managed to become internationally successful. A few notable exceptions are American companies such as Google (founded in 1998), Amazon (founded in 1994) or eBay Inc. (founded in 1995), and the Chinese online giant Alibaba (founded in 1998), which have come to be some of the largest internet companies in the world.  Topping the ranking of largest internet companies worldwide is currently Alphabet, the parent company of Google, with a market capitalization of 741 billion U.S. dollars as of June 2019. Having started as a PhD project at Stanford University, the Google project slowly gained traction and is now the number one search engine in the world, with a market share of 90 percent on the search engine market. Due to a number of high profile acquisitions, Google has expanded its portfolio beyond search, to include the video content sharing site YouTube, the digital app platform Google Play Store, the webmail service Gmail and the web browser Google Chrome, to only name a few.

As of that period, the mobile messaging app announced more than 217 million monthly active users. In October 2014, LINE had also reported 560 million registered users worldwide.  The Japanese messenger app LINE was developed by engineers at NHN Japan, an arm of the South Korean Naver Corporation, in response to damaged telecommunications infrastructure nationwide in the aftermath of the devastating T\u00c5\u008dhoku earthquake in March 2011. It was initially meant as an alternative communication channel for internal company use, but was released to the general public later that year.  Although it was intended as a mobile app for devices such as smartphones and tablet computers, later versions were made available on personal computers. Its main functions are exchanges of text, photo, video and audio messages, as well as performing of free Voice over IP (VoIP) conversations and video conferences, playing games and interacting with both personal connections and public accounts. As of 2012, LINE developed into a social network, with features similar to Facebook, such as a timeline where users can post status updates and other content. The sticker store, where users can create and sell their own LINE chat stickers, is one of LINE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most popular features among Japanese users.  LINE is ranked among the ten most successful mobile messenger apps in the world. It is at the same time the second most successful on the Asian market, after the Chinese-based WeChat, but before the Korean KakaoTalk."

In the last reported year, the multinational e-commerce company's net revenue was 280.5 billion U.S. dollars, up from 177.86 billion US dollars in 2017.  Amazon.com, an American electronic commerce company originally founded in 1994, is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest online retailer of books, clothing, electronics, music and many more goods. As of 2019, the company generates the majority of it's net revenues through online retail product sales, followed by third-party retail seller services, retail subscription services including Amazon Prime, and AWS. Amazon is also the producer of the leading e-book reader, the Amazon Kindle.  Through Amazon, consumers are able to purchase goods at a rather discounted price from both small and large companies as well as from other users. Both new and used goods are sold on the website. Due to the wide variety of goods available at prices which often undercut local brick-and-mortar retail offerings, Amazon has dominated the retailer market. As of 2019, Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brand worth amounts to approximately almost 315 billion U.S. dollars, topping the likes of companies such as Walmart, Ikea, as well as digital competitors Alibaba and eBay. One of Amazon's first forays into the world of hardware was its e-reader Kindle, one of the most popular e-book readers worldwide. In recently years, Amazon has also released smartphone, tablets and multimedia sticks under it's Fire brand in order to increase digital media consumption via these devices. This strategy is connected to the digital Amazon ecosystem which features video and audio content as value-added services for Prime subscribers.  Due to its location, Amazon offers more services in North America than worldwide. As a result, the majority of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net revenue in 2019 was actually earned in the United States and Canada. In 2019, approximately 170.77 billion U.S. dollars was earned in North America compared to only roughly 74.7 billion U.S. dollars internationally."

    "summary": "Traditional in-conference rivalry games such as Michigan vs. Ohio State and Alabama vs. LSU were among the most watched college football games of the 2018/19 season, garnering millions of viewers and generating more attention than most bowl games. Given the popularity of college football in the U.S., it is no surprise that the league\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s playoff and championship games are among the most watched sporting events in the country year after year."

Leclerc's share of the market is forecast to increase again in 2018, to 19.3 percent. The grocery retail landscape in France has been dominated by the Leclerc Group and Carrefour group, who have been fighting neck in neck for the lead position. Up until January 2017, Carrefour had the largest share of the grocery retail market, at which point Leclerc overtook it to become the largest supermarket in France.  Carrefour, however, is also the most valuable French food brand. France has one of the largest markets for online grocery shopping worldwide due to the early introduction of drive-through collection services, second only to the United Kingdom within Europe. The share of individuals who have purchased food or groceries online is thus increasing year on year."

It is projected that the numbers will gradually decrease to hit 4.46 million in 2023. The game reached the peak of its popularity in the second half of 2010, when Activision Blizzard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s estimates put the global number of WoW subscribers at 12 million. Before that, the number had been climbing steadily from 1.5 million in the first quarter of 2005, before exceeding five million in the fourth quarter of 2006 and 10 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. In 2011, the figures started falling and, by the first quarter of 2014, they decreased to the 2006 level. The predicted fall in numbers may be attributed to the fact that the game is now over 15 years old and that new online game modes, such as battle royale, have grown in popularity in recent years. The player count of Fortnite , for example, reached 350 million users worldwide in 2020."

In other words, it is a rate a creditor can demand by law from a defaulting debtor. This is different then, for example, the long-term interest rate, or yield on ten-year government bonds, in the Netherlands or the interest rate for new mortgages. Statutory interest for commercial transactions applies to deliveries to companies and the government, whilst in the case of deliveries to consumers the statutory interest rate for non-commercial transactions applies. Statutory interest cannot be claimed if there is a different rate of interest in a contract. In the event of a default at a commercial transaction after 01/12/2002, a creditor could impose an interest of eight percent in January 2019. In the last years, the statutory interest rate for non-commercial transactions decreased from three percent in July 2012 to two percent in January 2017.

    "summary": "Every four years in the United States, the electoral college system is used to determine the winner of the presidential election. In this system, each state has a fixed number of electors based on their population size, and (generally speaking) these electors then vote for their candidate with the most popular votes within their state or district. Since 1964, there have been 538 electoral votes available for presidential candidates, who need a minimum of 270 votes to win the election. Because of this system, candidates do not have to win over fifty percent of the popular votes across the country, but just win in enough states to receive a total of 270 electoral college votes. The use of this system is a source of debate in the U.S.; those in favor claim that it prevents candidates from focusing on the interests of urban populations, and must also appeal to smaller and less-populous states, and they say that this system preserves federalism and the two-party system. However, critics argue that this system does not represent the will of the majority of American voters, and that it encourages candidates to disproportionally focus on winning in swing states, where the outcome is more difficult to predict."

    "summary": "Like music, movies can be hard to pin down when it comes to which genre they are most aligned with. Cross-genre or hybrid-genre movies often have a broader appeal than those firmly lodged within a single genre \u00e2\u20ac?in fact, the latter types of movies can be quite divisive. A key example of this could be seen in a survey held in late 2018, which examined the most popular movie genres among adults in the United States based on gender, age, ethnicity, income, and more. The study revealed that comedy was the favorite genre among 90 percent of men and 91 percent of women, though drama, adventure, and action were similarly popular."

From the graph we can see that Shakespeare's tragedies tend to be the longest of his works, as six of his eight longest works are in this genre, while the other two are histories. The shortest of Shakespeare's works are his comedies, although there are also some tragedies, such as Macbeth, that have relatively low word counts. The longest play is Hamlet, which is the only Shakespeare play with more than thirty thousand words, and the shortest is The Comedy of Errors, which is the only play with fewer than fifteen thousand words. Shakespeare's 37 plays have an average word count of 22.6 thousand words per play."

    "summary": "Throughout U.S. history, the difference in the proportion of electoral votes has often been several times larger than the difference in the popular vote. For example, in the 1980s Ronald Reagan received roughly nine and eighteen percent more popular votes than his respective candidates, however he then received roughly seventy percent more electoral votes than both candidates. There are many critics of the electoral college system, whose main argument is that the most popular candidate is not always elected president, while its defenders argue that the system gives proportional representation to all Americans, and prevents candidates from ignoring the interests of those in less-populated states.  The United States uses the electoral college system to elect its presidents, which generally means that the most popular candidate in each state is then given that state's allocation of electoral votes (based on the state's population). Since 1968, there have been 538 electoral votes on offer in each election, meaning that he first candidate to reach 270 electoral votes is declared President. Since 1824, a popular vote has been held among the general public in order to determine the most popular candidate in each state (although women were not granted suffrage until 1920, while black and Native American voters faced widespread voter suppression until the 1960s). Because of the electoral college system, the proportion of popular votes won by a candidate may be very different than the proportion of electoral votes, and this has caused some instances where the candidate with the most electoral votes is declared President of the United States, despite losing the popular vote (such as in 2000 and 2016)."

More consumers in China stockpiled food than in any other country worldwide due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as of March 2020. Consumers from the United States rank fourth in this list as most of respondents surveyed in this country bought food items to stockpile for a couple of weeks. This kind of consumer behavior caused food and supply shortages in local grocery stores in various countries around the globe as shoppers didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to run short of food supplies during the pandemic-induced self-isolation period. Effect of coronavirus on tourism industry With COVID-19 having spread across 6 continents across the globe, many countries have introduced travel bans and curfews to contain the spread of this disease. These restrictions have almost brought the tourism industry to its knees which is predicted to lose over 75 million jobs in 2020. Most of these jobs will be lost in the Asia-Pacific region where Indonesia is expected to see the highest decline of tourist arrivals. European countries are predicted to lose over US$80 billion in revenue from the travel and tourism industry in 2020, as passengers are forced to stay at home for the near future."

    "summary": "This statistic displays the proportion of individuals who currently smoke cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos or a pipe in selected European countries in 2017. In this period, Greece had the highest proportion of smokers in the EU with 37 percent. Cigarette prices differ across Europe: the most expensive country in which to purchase cigarettes is the United Kingdom (UK). Cigarette prices in Europe are driven by the respective taxes imposed within each of the member states and consist of a specific duty per 1,000 cigarettes and an ad valorem rate onto the recommended retail price, in addition to value added tax (VAT). Thus the highest rates of taxation are reflected in the retail prices. Similar rates of taxation between countries are also found for hand rolling tobacco, where the highest levels of taxation are found in the United Kingdom once again. Governments that impose such strong barriers to the purchasing of tobacco are considered 'nanny states', with high levels of control on other factors, such as advertising, bans of tobacco products on retail displays and graphic warnings on cigarette packs."

    "summary": "The 1860 election cemented the Republican Party's position as one of the two major parties in U.S. politics, along with the already-established Democratic Party. Since this time, all U.S. presidents have been affiliated with these two parties, and their candidates have generally performed the best in each presidential election. In spite of this two-party dominance, there have always been third-party or independent candidates running on the ballot, either on a nationwide, regional or state level. No third-party candidate has ever won a U.S. election, although there have been several occasions where they have carried states or split the vote with major party candidates. Today, the largest third-party in U.S. politics is the Libertarian Party, who are considered to be socially liberal, but economically conservative; in the 2016 election, their nominee, Gary Johnson, secured just over three percent of the popular vote, while their latest candidate, Jo Jorgenson, is thought to have received just over one percent of the vote in the 2020 election."

    "summary": "This statistic depicts the price of a premium pack of 20 cigarettes across selected European countries in 2017. The price of cigarettes is substantially different across Europe. As of 2017, the most expensive country in which to purchase cigarettes was the United Kingdom (UK) with a premium pack of 20 cigarettes retailing at 9.91 British pounds, followed by Ireland at 9.15 British pounds. Cigarette prices in Europe are driven by the respective taxes imposed within each of the member states and consist of a specific duty per 1,000 cigarettes and an ad valorem rate onto the recommended retail price, in addition to value added tax (VAT). Thus the highest rates of taxation are reflected in the retail prices. Similar rates of taxation between countries are also found for hand rolling tobacco, where the highest levels of taxation are found in the United Kingdom once again. Governments that impose such strong barriers to the purchasing of tobacco are considered 'nanny states', with high levels of control on other factors, such as advertising, bans of tobacco products on retail displays and graphic warnings on cigarette packs."

    "summary": "This statistic illustrates the market share of the current accounts of leading banks in the United Kingdom (UK) as of 2014. Market share of current accounts is an important measure for comparison between banks, as a larger share of the current account market means that more customers are actively keeping their money with a particular bank. Furthermore, current account market share is important for the banks themselves as an increase in the market share of current accounts will lead to an increase in revenue, as all accounts, no matter the type, have a form of revenue associated with them. It can be seen that as of 2014, the London headquartered Lloyds Bank PLC had the largest share of the current accounts market. A total of more than one quarter (27 percent) of all current accounts were with Lloyds Bank PLC at that time. With a share of almost one fifth (18 percent) of the current accounts market each, Barclays Bank PLC and the Royal Bank of Scotland were joint second at that time. Since the introduction of \"current account switch service\" (CASS) by Payments Council, the gains and loses on the current accounts market by the leading banks have been closely monitored."

It is different to the concrete (point in time) measure. The second one is used to show the exchange rate as it looked like in a specific point in time, for example at end of the month or end of the year, at closing. Between years 2009 and 2012, the exchange rate noted a sharp decline in value, with the annual average exchange rate of the euro to the Canadian dollar falling 1.59 to 1.29 by 2012. This meant that one euro could buy 1.29 Canadian dollars. This sharp decline was most likely associated with the volatile changes brought to the financial markets by the global recession. Since 2012, the annual average euro to Canadian dollar exchange rate has recovered to the level of 1.49 as of 2019; however it remains to be lower, compared to 1999, the first year of the observation."

    "summary": "An executive order is one of the most commonly used form of administrative action taken by the President of the United States. It is where an order or directive is given and signed into law by the president, regarding the management of the U.S. government. Executive orders are generally used by presidents to influence U.S. laws and the administration of the country, without the need for a vote in Congress or the Supreme Court; although these orders are subject to judicial review, and can be challenged by the courts or another branch of government. If deemed unlawful or unconstitutional, the order will be revoked or cancelled, and a president may also revoke, cancel or amend any executive order that they, or any other presidents, have made. The U.S.' first 25 presidents signed a combined total of 1,262 executive orders in roughly 112 years, averaging at around 12 per year, however there was a large increase in the number of orders issued in the first half of the twentieth century. Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th U.S. president, was the first to issue more than one thousand executive orders alone; while Woodrow Wilson, who was in office during the First World War, signed more than 1,800."

In these 58 elections, Georgia has voted for the winning candidate 34 times, giving a success rate of 59 percent. As with most southern states, Georgia has traditionally voted for the more conservative candidate of the major parties; primarily voting Democrat in the nineteenth century and early twentieth century, before switching to the Republican Party in the 1960s (although it was considered a swing state in the 1970s and 1980s). Major party candidates have won the popular vote in Georgia in every elections, except in 1968 when George Wallace of the American Independent Party carried the state. Georgia has voted for the Democratic nominee 34 times, including every possible election from 1852 until 1960, and the Republican nominee on ten occasions, including all elections from 1996 to 2016. In the 2020 election, however, Georgia proved to have one of the closest counts nationwide, with Democratic nominee Joe Biden eventually flipping the state by a 0.2 percent margin after several recounts."

    "summary": "Since 1824, when the popular vote was first used to determine the overall winner in U.S. presidential elections, the share of the population who participate in these elections has gradually increased. Despite this increase, participation has never reached half of the total population; partly due to the share of the population below the voting age of eighteen, but also as many potential voters above the age of eighteen do not take part, or are ineligible to vote. For example, in the 2016 election, approximately twenty million U.S. adults were ineligible to vote, while over 94 million simply did not participate; in this election, Donald Trump won the electoral college with 63 million votes, which means that 19.4 percent of the total U.S. population (or 27.3 percent of eligible voters) voted for the current president."

A brand is defined here as the trademark and associated intellectual property. Football clubs are made up of a mixture of fixed tangible assets (stadium, training ground) and disclosed intangible assets (purchased players) with brand value.  To calculate brand values the Royalty Relief method was used. This approach assumes the company doesn't own their brand and must license it from a theoretical third party. The method determines how much it would cost to do this.  The English Premier League, which is a private company wholly owned by its member clubs, is the highest organized level of professional football (soccer) in England. In the league, 20 clubs compete for the championship playing each other twice during the course of the season. The league works on a system of promotion and relegation in conjunction with the subordinate Football League. The best three teams of the Football League are promoted each year and the worst three of the Premier League are relegated."

    "summary": "This statistic depicts the recommended retail price (RRP) of a typical pack of 20 cigarettes in the most popular price category in the United Kingdom (UK) from 2005 to 2017. The price of cigarettes has substantially increased each year since 2000. In 2015, the recommended retail price of a 20 pack of cigarettes was 9.16 British pounds. As of 2017, the most expensive country in which to purchase cigarettes in Europe was the United Kingdom. Cigarette prices across Europe are driven by the respective taxes imposed within each of the member states and consist of a specific duty per 1,000 cigarettes and an ad valorem rate onto the recommended retail price, in addition to value added tax (VAT). Thus the highest rates of taxation are reflected in the retail prices. Similar rates of taxation between countries are also found for hand rolling tobacco, where the highest levels of taxation are found in the United Kingdom once again. Governments that impose such strong barriers to the purchasing of tobacco are considered 'nanny states', with high levels of control on other factors, such as advertising, bans of tobacco products on retail displays and graphic warnings on cigarette packs."

Medical advancements, fewer wars and improved living standards also mean that people are living longer than they did in previous centuries.  Despite this overall increase, the life expectancy dropped three times since 1860; from 1865 to 1870 during the American Civil War, from 1915 to 1920 during the First World War and following Spanish Flu epidemic, and it has dropped again between 2015 and now.

There are approximately 516.5 million malnourished individuals living in the Asia and Pacific region and about 239 million malnourished living in Sub-Saharan Africa. Globally, there are 821.6 million people that are considered undernourished or starving. The term malnutrition includes both undernutrition and overnutrition. Undernutrition occurs when an individual cannot maintain normal bodily functions such as growth, recovering from disease, and both learning and physical work. Some conditions such as diarrhea, malaria, HIV/AIDS are considered major causes of undernutrition. Rural and agricultural communities can be especially susceptible to hunger during certain seasons. The annual hunger gap occurs when a family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s food supply may run out before the next season\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s harvest is available and can result in malnutrition.

The first democratically elected female Prime Minister was Sirimavo Bandaranaike of Sri Lanka, who took over the leadership of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party when her husband was assassinated in 1959. Bandaranaike successfully led her party to victory in three elections, in 1960, 1970 and 1994, however constitutional changes in the 1980s meant that her final term as Prime Minister was spent in a more ceremonial role, while the President now held the real executive power (although the President at this time was also a woman; Bandaranaike's daughter, Chandrika Kumaratunga). Sri Lanka is one of just thirteen countries that has had more than one woman in the highest position of executive power, and most of these countries can be found either in the Indian sub-continent or in Northwestern Europe. Of these thirteen, New Zealand and Finland are the only countries to have had three female leaders, including the current Prime Ministers; Jacinda Ardern and Sanna Marin."

The unemployment rate shows the share of unemployed people among potential employees available for the job market. This figure is calculated as follows - number of unemployed persons: number of unemployed persons + number of employed persons = unemployment rate (in percent).The status of being unemployed is defined as when an employed person is laid off, fired or quits his work and is still looking for a job. Even in a healthy economy unemployment occurs. If former employed persons go back to school or leave the job to take care of children they are not defined as unemployed. Unemployment can be a result of advanced technology, when machines replace worker tasks. Sometimes unemployment is caused by job outsourcing, when a company gets insolvent. Large-scale unemployment is also caused when consumer demands gets down and companies loose profit.Unemployment benefit payments in Germany are only paid, if you are unemployed and worked for the last 12 months. Otherwise benefits are received in the form of Arbeitslosengeld II, also called Hartz IV, which distributes social payments to people without an income who cannot work to make a living."

Case fatality rates are calculated by dividing the number of confirmed deaths by the number of confirmed cases. It is important to understand that the case fatality rate is not a good measure of the mortality risk of COVID-19. For a variety of reasons the case fatality rate varies over time and from country to country. Case fatality rates need to be interpreted with caution, especially when the total number of cases is not known, as is the current case with the COVID-19 pandemic. This statistic shows the development of the case fatality rates in select countries worldwide from February 25 to August 17, 2020."

    "summary": "This statistic illustrates the market share of grocery stores in Great Britain from August 2012 to August 2019. In the 12 weeks to August 11, 2019, Tesco's market share stood at 27 percent. Compared to a corresponding period in previous years, Tesco has progressively lost its share, while the discounters Aldi and Lidl have both gained share every year over the same 12 week periods. Prior to the popularity of the discounters, the grocery retail market was dominated by the 'big four' supermarkets: Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons. On the back of the economic recession and an inflation, however, consumer behavior has shifted in favor of cheaper alternatives and discount supermarkets.  The resulting 'price wars' has led to supermarkets lowering their prices and the  highest share of food volume sales on promotion  in Europe. Crucially, this has caused increased volatility in the grocery retail market and, as of January 2017, Aldi overtook the Co-operative to become the  fifth largest supermarket in the UK."
