Disney's first two fiscal quarters of 2020 were strong in terms of revenue, which the company partially attributed to the success of its new streaming service, Disney Plus (stylized as Disney+). However, merchandise licensing and studio entertainment results were adversely affected as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, without which Disney's revenue could have been much higher. By the company's third quarter, the coronavirus had more deeply affected operations as it meant a forced closure of parks, negatively impacting the Parks, Experiences, and Products segment."

Like four years previous, Norwegians had to dig deeper into their pockets than any of their European neighbors, with prices roughly 20,000 euros higher than the EU-28 average. Reasons for automobiles being so costly in Norway are partly due to higher tax rates than in most other European countries. A VAT of 25 percent is imposed on all new and used passenger vehicles imported into the country, while registration tax on cars considers weight, CO2 and NOx emissions of the car. These incentives contribute to making larger, heavier vehicles using petrol and diesel engines more expensive than anywhere else in Europe. The only vehicles exempt from VAT and tolls were electric cars. Electric vehicles are also extremely popular in Norway compared to most other countries; Norwegian buyers are able to spend more on high-tech models."

    "summary": "This statistic depicts the brand value of the most valuable Spanish football teams from 2011 to 2018. Real Madrid C.F. held the first place with a brand value of 1.57 billion U.S. dollars in 2018; followed by FC Barcelona and Club Atl\u00c3\u00a9tico de Madrid with 1.51 billion U.S. dollars and 0.43 billion U.S. dollars respectively.  A brand is defined here as the trademark and associated intellectual property. Football clubs are made up of a mixture of fixed tangible assets (stadium, training ground) and disclosed intangible assets (purchased players) with brand value.  To calculate brand values the Royalty Relief method was used. This approach assumes the company doesn't own their brand and must license it from a theoretical third party. The method determines how much it would cost to do this."

    "summary": "This statistic illustrates the market share of grocers in Great Britain (GB) monthly from January 2015 to October 2020. During the coronavirus outbreak Ocado, Symbols & Independents, the cooperative, Iceland and other outlets managed to increase their share of the market the most. Asda was especially hard hit and lost almost a percent of its market share from March of 2020 to May 2020. Tesco and Sainsbury's had the largest share over the period under consideration, holding 41.8 percent of the market together as of October 2020. In March of 2019 Asda's share surpassed Sainsbury's which could recover the second position on the market in the following month. Prior to the popularity of the discounters, the grocery retail market was dominated by the 'big four' supermarkets: Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons. On the back of the post-Brexit uncertainty and growing inflation, however, consumer behavior has shifted in favor of cheaper alternatives such as Aldi and Lidl.The resulting 'price wars' have led to supermarkets lowering their prices. Crucially, this has caused increased volatility in the grocery retail market and, as of January 2017, Aldi overtook the Co-operative to become the fifth largest supermarket in the United Kingdom. After a period of intense competition Lidl overtook Waitrose and is now poised to likely overtake the Cooperative in the coming year."

China, alone, produced about 28.8 percent of the global territorial fossil fuel CO2 emissions. It is likely that top emitting countries will continue releasing more carbon dioxide every year. Yet, the level of emissions in high income countries have stabilized in comparison to the large emissions growth in low- and middle-income regions.
