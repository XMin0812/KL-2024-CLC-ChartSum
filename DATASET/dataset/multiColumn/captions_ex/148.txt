Norway is the main supplier of both crude oil and natural gas for the United Kingdom . In 2019 , some 17.5 million metric tons of crude oil and 1.7 million metric tons of natural gas were imported from Norway . This is significantly higher than the amount imported from the second entry â€“ the United States . Algeria , Russia and Nigeria round out the top five origin countries , with Russia being the only other supplier of natural gas to the UK , as this is reliant on pipeline infrastructure . That year , the United Kingdom imported approximately 46.9 million metric tons of crude oil and natural gas liquids .
