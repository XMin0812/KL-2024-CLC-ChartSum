The largest carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) emitter in the world is Asia Pacific , where there was 17.27 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide emitted in 2019 . China , alone , produced about 28.8 percent of the global territorial fossil fuel CO2 emissions . It is likely that top emitting countries will continue releasing more carbon dioxide every year .

However , based on per capita emissions , countries like the United States , Australia , and Canada are the largest CO2 emitters in the world .
