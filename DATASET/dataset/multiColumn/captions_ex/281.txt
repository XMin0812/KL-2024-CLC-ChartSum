Men were consecutively more likely than women to pass practical driving tests in the United Kingdom . In the past nine years , the gap between pass rates for male and female participants has stayed relatively stable , recording a net increase of 2.3 percent for men and 1.1 percent for women . This was despite a noticeable slump in the most recently surveyed time period . Practical and theory tests for car driving have been separated since 1997 , with the last change in practical test layout implemented in December 2017 . That month , only 45 percent of those taking the practical test had passed .
