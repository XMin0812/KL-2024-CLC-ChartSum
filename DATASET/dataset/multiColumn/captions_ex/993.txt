An executive order is one of the most commonly used form of administrative action taken by the President of the United States . It is where an order or directive is given and signed into law by the president , regarding the management of the U.S. government . Executive orders are generally used by presidents to influence U.S. laws and the administration of the country , without the need for a vote in Congress or the Supreme Court ; although these orders are subject to judicial review , and can be challenged by the courts or another branch of government . If deemed unlawful or unconstitutional , the order will be revoked or cancelled , and a president may also revoke , cancel or amend any executive order that they , or any other presidents , have made . The U.S. ' first 25 presidents signed a combined total of 1,262 executive orders in roughly 112 years , averaging at around 12 per year , however there was a large increase in the number of orders issued in the first half of the twentieth century . Theodore Roosevelt , the 26th U.S. president , was the first to issue more than one thousand executive orders alone ; while Woodrow Wilson , who was in office during the First World War , signed more than 1,800 .
