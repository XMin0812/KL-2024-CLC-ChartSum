Since the 1860 election , U.S. presidential elections have been dominated by candidates affiliated with the Democratic and Republican parties . While the electoral votes decide the winner of the election , these are generally decided by the winner of the popular vote in each state ( or district ) , and the winner of the nationwide popular vote does not always go on to win the electoral vote . Interestingly , there have been a number of occasions where the winner of the popular vote did not go on to win the electoral vote , for example in the 2016 election , or , most famously , in 2000 .
