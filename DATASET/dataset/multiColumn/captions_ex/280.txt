This statistic shows the population of the Netherlands from 2010 to 2018 , by religion . It shows that the percentage of the people that does not identify with any religion continued to grow between 2010 and 2018 , from 45 to 53 percent of the people . The largest group in 2018 was the Roman Catholic group with 22 percent of the Dutch people identifying as Roman Catholic . That is particularly interesting , as the dominating church in the Netherlands since the Reformation had been the Protestant church . According to the source , in 2018 15 percent of the Dutch population considered themselves a member of the three main protestant churches , the Dutch Reformed Church , the Protestant Church in the Netherlands and the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands . Although some people in the Netherlands fear the increase in the number of Muslims , this statistic actually shows that the share of Muslims living in the Netherlands remained stable between 2010 and 2018 , with Muslims making up five percent of the Dutch population .
