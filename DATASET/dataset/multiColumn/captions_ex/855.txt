This statistic shows the market share of grocery store brands in France for the years 2008 , 2013 and a forecast for 2018 . The leading three supermarkets based on market share in 2013 were `` Systeme A '' ( Auchan and System U partnership ) , Carrefour and Leclerc . Leclerc 's share of the market is forecast to increase again in 2018 , to 19.3 percent . The grocery retail landscape in France has been dominated by the Leclerc Group and Carrefour group , who have been fighting neck in neck for the lead position . Up until January 2017 , Carrefour had the largest share of the grocery retail market , at which point Leclerc overtook it to become the largest supermarket in France . Carrefour , however , is also the most valuable French food brand . France has one of the largest markets for online grocery shopping worldwide due to the early introduction of drive-through collection services , second only to the United Kingdom within Europe . The share of individuals who have purchased food or groceries online is thus increasing year on year .
