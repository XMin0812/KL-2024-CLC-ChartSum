In 2019 , Airbus took gross orders for 1,131 aircraft . This compares to 246 gross orders received by Boeing , a decline of almost 80 percent compared to 2018 . In 2019 , Boeing 's customers made contractual changes to some 192 orders , bringing the number of net orders down to only 54 jets - and this is after factoring in conversions from previous years ( due to contractual cancellations and adjustments made in response to the ASC 606 revenue recognition standard , Boeing 's net orders excluding conversions and cancellations came to a negative 87 units ) . The slump in orders means that the company 's book-to-bill ratio dropped to a negative 0.23 . Boeing 's deliveries stood at 380 units .
