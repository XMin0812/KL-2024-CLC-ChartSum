Although the founding fathers declared American independence in 1776 , and the subsequent Revolutionary War ended in 1783 , individual states did not officially join the union until 1787 . The first states to ratify the U.S. Constitution were Delaware , Pennsylvania and New Jersey , in December 1787 , and they were joined by the remainder of the thirteen ex-British colonies by 1790 . Another three states joined before the turn of the nineteenth century , and there were 45 states by 1900 . The final states , Alaska and Hawaii , were admitted to the union in 1959 , almost 172 years after the first colonies became federal states .
