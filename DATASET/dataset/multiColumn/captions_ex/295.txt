Ireland was the European country with the largest share of diesel cars . Although the share of diesel car sale shares in Ireland was quite high in 2018 , that number has dropped significantly since 2014 from 73 percent to 54 percent . In comparison , Italy has only seen a decrease from 55 percent to 51 percent in the same timeframe . The overall reduction in diesel car sales is unsurprising given the 2015 diesel scandal and subsequent discussions surrounding health and environmental impacts of the fuel type .
