Since 1789 , 44 different men have served as President of the United States ( Grover Cleveland served as the 22nd and 24th president ; this is why Donald Trump is officially the 45th president ) , and the average age of these men when taking office for the first time was approximately 56 years and 82 days . When President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated on January 20 , 2021 , this average will increase to 56 years and 261 days . Generally speaking , Republican Party presidents have a fairly even split above and below the average age , whereas roughly two thirds of Democratic candidates have been younger than this average when assuming office . The first nine U.S. presidents were all older than 57 years old .
