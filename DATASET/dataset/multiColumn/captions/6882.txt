The 1980 US presidential election was contested between incumbent President Jimmy Carter of the Democratic Party , Ronald Reagan of the Republican Party , and independent candidate John B. Anderson . Carter became increasingly unpopular as his term progressed , due to increased tensions from the Cold War and the Iran Hostage Crisis , as well as high unemployment and a worsening economy . Carter faced off against Ted Kennedy ( the youngest sibling of President John F. Kennedy ) for the Democratic nomination , and Carter defeated Kennedy in 24 out of 34 primaries , returning his name to the ballot . Ronald Reagan had been a major figure in the Republican Party for over a decade , and was particularly popular among the conservative wing of the party . Reagan faced many opponents in the Republican Party , and his two closest rivals were future-President George H. W. Bush , and John B. Anderson . Reagan won convincingly , and convinced Bush to run as his vice president , while Anderson also stayed in the race as an independent candidate . Ed Clarke was the Libertarian Party 's candidate . This was also the first election in which the National Rifle Association ( NRA ) publicly endorsed a nominee .
