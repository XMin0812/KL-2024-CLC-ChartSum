This statistic presents the most important attributes of facial skin care products to male and female consumers in the United Kingdom , according to a survey conducted in March 2013 . Skin moisturising and hydrating attributes were considered the most important attributes for both genders , with 73 percent of women stating this as important . The anti-ageing moisturiser market takes up the largest proportion of the facial skin care market with a share of 41.6 percent in 2013 . Over The Counter skin treatments , or OTC 's have seen a significant decline in sales value since 2009 , with a decline of nearly 210 million British pounds . This could be due to harder regulation in European countries , or by the fact that consumers are more interested in organic and natural skin products . A total of 54 percent of people claimed that they want no chemical ingredients in their personal care products and 30 percent stated that they want non animal tested products .
