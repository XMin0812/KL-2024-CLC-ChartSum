This graph shows the population of Portugal from 1864 until 2020 , by gender . Throughout this period the number of women has always outnumbered men since 1864 . In the first entry the number of men was 2 million people , and the number of women was 2.2 million . We can see that this difference remained until the turn of the twentieth century when the gap became broader . From 1910 until 1920 the population of Portugal experienced limited growth as a result of food shortages and influenza , and women appear to have been more heavily affected by this than men . From this point onwards the number of men and women follow a similar trend , although the growth and decline rate for men fluctuates more than women . The population falls in the 1960s , as many Portuguese people migrated in search of work , and the number of men fell faster than the number of women during this time . As time progresses the difference in the number of men and women decreases , until 2005 where the number of men starts to decrease before the number of women does . This decline came as many Portuguese people emigrated in search of work abroad , and the number of men falls faster than the number of men , as men are statistically more likely to migrate in search of work than women .
