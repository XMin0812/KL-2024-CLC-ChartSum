The Emerging Markets Bond Index ( EMBI ) , commonly known as `` riesgo pa√≠s '' in Spanish speaking countries , is a weighted financial benchmark that measures the interest rates paid each day by a selected portfolio of government bonds from emerging countries . It is measured in base points , which reflect the difference between the return rates paid by emerging countries ' government bonds and those offered by U.S. Treasury bills . This difference is defined as `` spread '' .
