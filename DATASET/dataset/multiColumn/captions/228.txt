Every four years in the United States , the electoral college system is used to determine the winner of the presidential election . In this system , each state has a fixed number of electors based on their population size , and ( generally speaking ) these electors then vote for their candidate with the most popular votes within their state or district . Since 1964 , there have been 538 electoral votes available for presidential candidates , who need a minimum of 270 votes to win the election . Because of this system , candidates do not have to win over fifty percent of the popular votes across the country , but just win in enough states to receive a total of 270 electoral college votes . The use of this system is a source of debate in the U.S. ; those in favor claim that it prevents candidates from focusing on the interests of urban populations , and must also appeal to smaller and less-populous states , and they say that this system preserves federalism and the two-party system . However , critics argue that this system does not represent the will of the majority of American voters , and that it encourages candidates to disproportionally focus on winning in swing states , where the outcome is more difficult to predict .
