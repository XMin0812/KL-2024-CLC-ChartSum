The Battle of Gettysburg , at the beginning of July 1963 , was the largest and costliest battle of the American Civil War , and is often regarded as the turning point in the war . Confederate General Robert E. Lee sought to capitalize on his victories earlier in the year , such as the Battle of Chancellorsville , by launching his second invasion of the northern states . He did this in order to alleviate the pressure on the Virginia farmland , which had been ravaged by the preceding campaigns , and also in an attempt to force the Union into negotiations to end the war . In June , General Lee 's forces marched through Virginia , into Pennsylvania , and were pursued by Union forces led by Major General Joseph Hooker , and later Maj. Gen. George G. Meade .
