With the conquest of the kingdoms Mercia in 827 , King Egbert of Wessex became the first ruler of the Anglo-Saxon people . Since this time , there have been 68 rulers of England and ( since 1707 ) Great Britain . The majority of these rulers have inherited their title and crown from their mother or father , or as a result of their family ties , although some of the people on this list obtained their title through marriage or conquest , while others simply made a claim to the throne that was not always acknowledged by their subjects . The longest serving of these rulers is the current monarch , Queen Elizabeth II , who has been the British monarch for over 68 years . The shortest reign on this list belongs to Lady Jane Grey in 1553 , who had been named Edward VI 's successor in his will , however Jane was deposed after just nine days by Edward 's half-sister Mary I ( Bloody Mary ) , and she was subsequently executed for treason at the age of 16 .
