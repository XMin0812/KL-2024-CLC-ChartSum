Like music , movies can be hard to pin down when it comes to which genre they are most aligned with . Cross-genre or hybrid-genre movies often have a broader appeal than those firmly lodged within a single genre â€“ in fact , the latter types of movies can be quite divisive . A key example of this could be seen in a survey held in late 2018 , which examined the most popular movie genres among adults in the United States based on gender , age , ethnicity , income , and more . The study revealed that comedy was the favorite genre among 90 percent of men and 91 percent of women , though drama , adventure , and action were similarly popular .
