Part V of the Treaty of Versailles dealt with all aspects of the German military , with Section II specifically dealing with Germany 's navy and the restrictions put in place following the First World War . In total , the Allied powers allowed Germany 's navy to have just 36 ships in total , with strict limitations regarding the type , size , and replacement periods for each ship . In addition to this , the Allies demanded that Germany surrendered over one hundred military ships ( disarmed , but with all weapons on board ) , while a further 32 warships were to be converted for commercial use ( this does not include the commercial ships also annexed by the Allies ) .
