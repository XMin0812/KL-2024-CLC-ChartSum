In 1950 , when Estonia 's population was estimated at 1.1 million people , approximately 57 percent of the population was female , while 43 percent was male ; this equated to a difference of more than 160,000 people . In the past century , as with many former-Soviet states , Estonia has consistently had one of the most disproportionate gender ratios in the world . The reason for this was due to the large number of men who were killed in wars during the first half of the twentieth century , which was particularly high across the Soviet Union , as well as a much higher life expectancy among women . The difference in the number of men and women in Estonia has gradually decreased over the past seven decades , but in 2020 , there are still 70,000 more females than males , in a population of 1.3 million people ; this equates to total shares of roughly 53 percent and 47 percent of the total population respectively .
