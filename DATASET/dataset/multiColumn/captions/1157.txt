In U.S. presidential elections since 1964 , voters in the 18 to 24 age bracket have traditionally had the lowest turnout rates among all ethnicities . From 1964 until 1996 , white voters in this age bracket had the highest turnout rates of the four major ethnic groups in the U.S. , particularly those of non-Hispanic origin ; however participation was highest among young African Americans in 2008 and 2012 , during the elections where Barack Obama , the U.S. ' first African-American major party candidate , was nominated . Young Asian American and Hispanic voters generally have the lowest turnout rates , and were frequently below half of the overall 18 to 24 turnout before the 2000s .
