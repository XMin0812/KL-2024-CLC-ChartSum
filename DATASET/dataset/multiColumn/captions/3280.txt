The Battle of Chancellorsville was General Robert E Lee 's `` perfect battle , '' as his strategical maneuvers and tactical risks paid off and led to a Confederate victory , despite the Union armies outnumbering the Confederacy by forty thousand . This battle began when Union Major General Joseph Hooker moved his armies behind Lee 's position at Fredericksburg , an an attempt to attack him while he was busy facing another Union force . In a surprise move , Lee left roughly 20 percent of his men to defend Fredericksburg , and took the rest of his men to meet Hooker 's armies , removing Hooker 's element of surprise , and the subsequent fighting then forced Hooker back to Chancellorsville where he took up a defensive position . Lee then divided his army again , sending another force , led by Lieutenant General Thomas J . `` Stonewall '' Jackson , to flank one of the Union army corps at Chancellorsville . The risky decision was a success , however Jackson was wounded by friendly fire while on a reconnaissance mission , and died eight days later . The heaviest fighting of the battle ( and second bloodiest day of the American Civil War ) was on May 3 , 1863 , where Lee finally pushed the Union forces out of Chancellorsville , before he was yet again forced to divide his army to face the Union force that had defeated the men Lee had left at Fredericksburg . The decision was another success , and despite the inferior numbers , Lee 's decisions to split his armies at pivotal times took his enemies by surprise , and gave him an overall victory . This victory paved the way for Lee to launch his second invasion of the north in June 1863 , where he would eventually be defeated at the Battle of Gettysburg .
