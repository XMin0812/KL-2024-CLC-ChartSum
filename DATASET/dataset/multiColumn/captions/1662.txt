In October 2020 , Sydney Kingsford Smith International airport in Australia saw a total of 187,000 domestic passengers pass through the airport . This was a reduction of just over 92 percent on the total number of domestic passengers in the previous year , a change that was heavily influenced by the novel coronavirus outbreak at the end of 2019 and subsequent travel restrictions from early February onwards .
