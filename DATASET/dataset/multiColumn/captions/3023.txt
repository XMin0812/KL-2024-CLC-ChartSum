The First Battle of the Somme is acknowledged was one of the most devastating and bloodiest battles of all time . The battle took place during the First World War , between allied British and French forces and opposing German forces , from July 1 to November 18 , 1916 . Initially this attack was supposed to be led by the French army , however their focus changed to the Battle of Verdun , where they were locked in a deadly stalemate against the German forces , therefore the role of the British changed from support to that of the lead . After a week of heavy bombardment from British artillery , on the morning of July 1 , 1916 over 100 thousand British troops charged the enemy lines , in what would become the bloodiest day in the history of the British Army . The German trenches were dug so deeply that the artillery fire did not have its desired effect , and it failed to sufficiently clear much of the barbed wire , meaning that the German machine guns were able to mow down thousands of oncoming troops as they tried to rush across no mans land . By the end of the day , the British troops secured approximately 8 square kilometers of ground , along a front that stretched 24km ( averaging just 0.33km from the initial line of attack ) , at a cost of over 57 thousand casualties , including over 19 thousand fatalities . By comparison , the German and French armies were of relatively similar sizes , however their fatality rate was much lower .
