Maryland has cast electoral ballots in every U.S. presidential election , and has correctly given the majority of its electoral votes to the overall winner in 39 out of 59 elections , resulting in a success rate of 66 percent . Apart from the first two U.S. elections , where George Washington was elected unanimously , Maryland has voted for a major party candidate in all but one elections ; this was in 1856 , where Maryland was the only state carried by the Know Nothing Party 's Millard Fillmore . In early elections , Maryland 's electors cast separate ballots for the most popular candidate in their district , although this system fell out of use in the 1830s . Since the 1850s , Maryland has generally voted for the Democratic nominee , siding with the Democrats in 29 elections , and the Republicans twelve times . In the 2020 election , Maryland was a comfortable victory for Democratic nominee Joe Biden , whose share of the popular vote was over double that of his rival , Donald Trump .
