The Coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) pandemic is having a damaging impact on the hotel industry across Europe . The first case of coronavirus was confirmed on January 24 in France , shortly followed by other European countries . In February , the impact on revenues per available room ( RevPar ) was still relatively small , with the exception of Italy where the number of cases grew rapidly . By March , lockdowns and restrictions on unnecessary travel were implemented in other countries too , resulting in negative results across the region ; Italy experienced an 85 percent drop in RevPar in March , while hotels in Greece recorded a 52.4 percent decline .
