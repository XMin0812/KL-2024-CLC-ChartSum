According to a survey about the impact of the coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) on Indians in March 2020 , a majority of respondents had no critical non-essential purchases during the lockdown . About 56 percent needed home supplies , and most of these needed them ordered online . In contrast , about eight percent each for online and local purchases required electronics in order to attend online classes or be able to work from home . India implemented a lockdown for 21 days , announced on March 24 , 2020 . This was after the `` Janata Curfew '' on March 22 , 2020 - a so-called practice lockdown . Panic-buying commenced among consumers days before the lockdown was announced , much like in other countries . This lockdown was the largest in the world , restricting 1.3 billion people .
