Although vaccination was discovered in England in 1796 , the practice was not made compulsory until 1853 in England and Wales , and 1864 in Scotland . For this reason , the number of smallpox deaths per million people fluctuated from year to year , often doubling or tripling from one year to the next , before the death rate for both countries settled in the late 1960s . The Great Pandemic of the 1870s , which was the last major smallpox pandemic in Europe , caused the number of smallpox deaths to soar once more , peaking at over 1,000 deaths per million people in England and Wales in 1871 , and at over 820 deaths per million people in Scotland in 1872 . During this pandemic , mandatory vaccination became enforced , where parents who did not vaccinate their children within the first three years of life were penalized with fines or imprisonment , and this helped the smallpox death rate to remain low and plateau in the final two decades of the nineteenth century ; an estimated 11,000 of these penalties were handed out during the 1880s , which included 115 prison sentences for failure to vaccinate children . Smallpox cases in Britain were rare throughout the early twentieth century ; not counting a lab accident in 1978 that infected two people ( one of whom died ) , natural smallpox cases were eradicated in Britain in 1934 .
