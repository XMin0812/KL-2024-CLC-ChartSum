They assess the value of immovable property , such as houses , by carrying out a taxation . The calculation of this WOZ value is based on the amount the property would have sold for on the reference date ( January 1st of the previous year ) . The value is passed on to the water authorities and the Tax and Customs Administration and is being used to calculate taxes . In 2019 , the average selling price for residential property in the Netherlands was approximately 287,000 euros , which was higher than its average WOZ value of approximately 307,000 euros .
