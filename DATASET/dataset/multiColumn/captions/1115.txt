Monthly sales of grocery stores in Canada hit a high of 10.39 billion Canadian dollars in March 2020 , an increase of over two billion compared to the previous month . The spread of coronavirus in early March 2020 and consequent panic buying can explain this jump in sales . Monthly grocery store sales had declined to around 8.93 billion Canadian dollars by August 2020 .
