Although sales remained down following the re-opening of bars , pubs , and restaurants in Great Britain in July 2020 , figures show signs of recovery for the industry . In August 2020 , like-for-like sales of pubs and restaurants were only down around 10 percent compared to 2019 , largely down the influence of the 'Eat of to Help Out ' scheme . Sales dipped again in September , as the scheme ended , with bars suffering the most with a 42.7 percent fall . Like-for-like sales had already begun to fall at the beginning of March when the public were warned to avoid pubs , restaurants and other venues in an attempt to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus . Shortly after , the country went into a full lockdown , with premises only able to open for takeaway and delivery .
