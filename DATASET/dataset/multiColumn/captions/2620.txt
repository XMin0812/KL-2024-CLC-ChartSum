The Battle of Antietam ( also known as the Battle of Sharpsburg ) is the single bloodiest day in United States history , with almost 23 thousand total casualties , which included over 3.6 thousand fatalities . The battle began at dawn on September 17 , 1862 , as General Robert E. Lee 's Confederate army were attacked by Major General George B. McClellan near Antietam Creek , Maryland . While the union had almost double the Confederate numbers , McClellan did not commit his full force , and did not capitalize and push his attack any time he broke Lee 's defensive line . This meant that Lee 's men were able to hold off the Union army until reinforcements arrived in the evening and drove the battered Union army back , thus ending the battle . Although some skirmishes took place in the day before and after the 17th , they pale in comparison to the violence and losses suffered on that day .
