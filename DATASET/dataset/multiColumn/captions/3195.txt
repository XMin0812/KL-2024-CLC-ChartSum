Missouri has taken part in all 51 U.S. presidential elections since 1820 , voting for the winning candidate on 37 occasions , giving a success rate of 73 percent . Missouri was a staunchly Democrat state for most of the nineteenth century , only voting Republican during the Civil War and Reconstruction . Throughout the twentieth century , Missouri was the epitomic bellwether state ; siding with the winning candidate in 23 out of 25 elections , only failing to vote for the nationwide winner in 1900 and 1956 . The Show-Me State has voted for the Republican Party 's nominee in the past six elections , with Donald Trump winning the 2016 election in Missouri by the largest margin in over three decades ; the state 's status has changed from being a battleground state to a safe red state , and in the 2020 election , Donald Trump won the state again , with the same share of the popular vote .
