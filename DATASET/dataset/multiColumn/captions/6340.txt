During a survey conducted in March 2020 among consumers in the United States it was found that in light of the COVID-19 pandemic respondents were less inclined to buy products or services that were advertised by means of showing people closely interacting with each other . For instance , 59 percent said that if they saw and presenting people kissing then they would be less likely to purchase that product . The opposite was true for two percent of respondents . This closely correlates with consumer perception of such advertising , where 53 percent of Americans found ads portraying people kissing as inappropriate in times when social distancing is encouraged due to coronavirus outbreak .
