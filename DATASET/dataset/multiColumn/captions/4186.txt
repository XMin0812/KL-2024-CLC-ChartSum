Since the presidency was established , sitting U.S. presidents have campaigned for re-election 28 times in total , with 18 successful re-elections , and ten unsuccessful campaigns . When compared with the proportional difference in the electoral votes , the change in popular votes is often much smaller . The largest difference in popular votes occurred in 1912 , where William Taft 's share of the votes was 28.4 percent lower than in 1908 ; this was due to former-President Theodore Roosevelt 's campaign as a third party candidate , which syphoned off a large share of Republican support . The smallest ever difference in share of the popular votes occurred in 1888 , where Grover Cleveland 's share of the popular vote was 0.1 percent higher than in 1884 , although he still lost . The only other case of a sitting president winning a higher share of the popular vote but failing to win re-election was in 2020 ; this was due to the reduced support for third party candidates compared to the 2016 election .
