The Siege of Vicksburg was one of the most tactically important victories for the Union in the American Civil War , as it helped give them control of the Mississippi River , while cutting off a major supply line for the Union forces . When Major General Ulysses S. Grant 's Union troops tried taking the fortress by force , in mid-May 1863 , they were twice pushed back with heavy casualties . Instead of sending his men to try a third time , Grant then used artillery to besiege the city on a daily basis , and cut off all supply networks into the city . The inhabitants survived for another forty days before running out of provisions , ( many reports claim the starving inhabitants had to resort to eating dogs and rats in order to survive ) and surrendering on July 4 . Independence Day was not celebrated in Vicksburg again until after the Second World War , 81 years later .
