The 1972 US presidential election was contested between incumbent President Richard Nixon of the Republican Party , and the Democratic Party 's George S. McGovern . Nixon won the Republican nomination easily , and was the firm favorite to win the election , due to his foreign policy ( particularly when dealing with China and the Soviet Union ) and the healthy state of the US economy . The early favorite in the Democratic Primary was Ed Muskie , although a forged letter ( later revealed to have come from Nixon 's campaign ) claimed that Muskie had made disparaging remarks against French-Canadians , and this damaged his reputation in New England . When the press attacked Muskie 's wife 's character , the candidate made a statement refuting their claims , however the press used it as another opportunity to attack him , effectively ending his campaign . McGovern then became the frontrunner , although a significant challenge from Arthur Bremer was cut short when he was shot five times and paralyzed from the waist down . McGovern then went on to win easily , however notable other candidates were Shirley Chisholm , the first African-American woman to run for either of the major party 's nominations , and Patsy Mink , the first Asian American to run for the Democratic nomination . The only major third party candidate was John Hospers of the American Independent Party , while this was also the first time the Libertarian Party , which is the third largest political party in the US as of 2020 , featured on the ballot .
