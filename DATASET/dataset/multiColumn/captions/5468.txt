Throughout United States history , voter turnout among the voting eligible population has varied , ranging from below twelve percent in uncontested elections , to 83 percent in the 1876 election . In early years , turnout in presidential elections was relatively low , as the popular vote was not used in every state to decide who electors would vote for . When this was changed in the 1824 election , turnout increased dramatically , and generally fluctuated between seventy and eighty percent during the second half of the nineteenth century . Until the 1840 and 1842 elections , midterm elections also had a higher turnout rate than their corresponding presidential elections , although this trend has been reversed since these years .
