The javelin throw was added to the men 's Summer Olympic roster in the 1908 Olympic Games in London , while the women 's event first appeared in the 1932 Olympics in Los Angeles . As with the discus throw , the javelin appeared in the Ancient Olympic Games , and was contested in two formats ; measuring distance and accuracy . The sport was then resurrected in Germany and Scandinavia in the 1870s , and gradually developed into it 's current format , with two-handed and freestyle variations of the event passing out of popularity by the 1920s . Today , the restrictions on the javelins are 800 grams in weight and between 2.6 and 2.7 meters in length for men , and 600 grams in weight and between 2.2 and 2.3 meters in length for women . In contrast to other throwing events , there are strict guidelines for the technique used to throw the javelin , as certain experimental and freestyle methods used in the 1950s were seen as a danger to the audience .
