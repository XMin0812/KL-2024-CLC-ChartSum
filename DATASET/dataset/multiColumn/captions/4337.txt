Liver cirrhosis is a chronic disease , which occurs when long-term damage and scarring to the liver prevents it from functioning to its full capacity . Although the human liver is the only organ with the capacity to regenerate itself ; there is no cure for liver cirrhosis , however the effects of the condition can be slowed and even minimalized by removing the cause of the damage . The most common causes of liver cirrhosis are alcohol abuse and hepatitis . While hepatitis can be combatted with vaccinations and medication , alcohol abuse can be more complicated due to the psychological impact it has on the user . The prevention of alcohol abuse and its side-effects was one of the major aims of the Prohibition movement in the United States in the 1920s , and records show that the number of deaths due to liver cirrhosis decreased greatly during the Prohibition era , and rose again following Prohibition 's repeal in 1933 . In the early 1900s , the death rate due to cirrhosis of the liver was as high as 14.8 deaths per 100,000 people , however it gradually fell in the wartime Prohibition of the First World War , and then plateaued at half of this level , between 7.1 and 7.5 deaths per 100,000 people , during federal Prohibition in the 1920s and early 1930s . After Prohibition was repealed at the end of 1933 , deaths due to liver cirrhosis increased again , and by the late 1960s , the rate was consistently double it 's Prohibition era level .
