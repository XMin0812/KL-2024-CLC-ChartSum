In the American Civil War , Union and Confederate officers were paid very similarly until they reached the rank of Lieutenant , however Union allowances were generally higher than those of the Confederacy , which means that their wages would have been higher . The Union also paid their more highly ranked officers better than the Confederacy , with Generals receiving much more . For example , a Union colonel would receive the cash value of six human and three horse rations per day , amounting to an extra 78 dollars . It is also important to note that the Confederacy did have generous bonuses for their generals , such as time served , and whether they took an active role on the battlefield . For example , General Robert E. Lee would have officially received 301 dollars per month , but with bonuses he would have received 604 dollars .
