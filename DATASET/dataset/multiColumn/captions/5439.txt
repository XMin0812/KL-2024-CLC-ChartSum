During the outbreak of the coronavirus outbreak , the number of visits to shopping centers in Poland fell by 5.6 percent compared to the results of March 2019 . The most significant drops were recorded in centers with small and medium rentable space . Very small centers were the only ones to record a lowest decline compared to the same period a year ago . It results from the possibility of making quick purchases of food and basic household goods . It should be mentioned that these decreases will be even more significant due to the announcement of an epidemic state by the Polish government on 13 March 2020 . Thus , customers will be able to visit shopping centers to take advantage of the offer of grocery stores , pharmacies , and drugstores . The retail trade in shopping malls ( > 2,000 sq m ) offering fashion , but also in cafes , restaurants , and entertainment points , has been halted .
