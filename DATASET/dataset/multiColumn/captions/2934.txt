When comparing the average speeds across athletics events , the 4x100 meter relay is the fastest event for both men and women . When setting the Olympic Records in 2012 , Jamaica 's men 's team ran at over 39km/h throughout the event , while the USA 's women 's team ran at over 35 km/h . Both of these speeds are more than 1km/h faster than those recorded in the individual 100m sprints ; the reason for this is that only the first relay runner starts from a stationary position , while the other three runners are able to build up momentum ( usually reaching speeds close to their top speed ) before starting their own leg . For example , when Jamaica set the world record in the 4x100m relay in 2015 , Usain Bolt ran the final leg of the race in 8.65 seconds ; almost a full second faster than his world record in the 100m sprint .
