The Olympic marathon has been a permanent fixture in the men 's roster since the inaugural Athens Games of 1896 , while the women 's event was first held 88 years later in Los Angeles . Ethiopian athletes have enjoyed the most success in Olympic marathons , with men winning four golds ; two of which came from Abebe Bikila in 1960 and 1964 , who was the first athlete to win back-to-back golds ( the only other athlete to win two golds in the marathon was East Germany 's Waldemar Cierpinski in 1976 and 1980 ) , and Ethiopian women have won two golds . The Olympic records are 2 hours , 6 minutes and 32 seconds for men , set by Kenya 's Samuel Wanjiru in 2008 ; and for women it 's 2 hours , 32 minutes and 7 seconds , set by Tiki Gelana of Ethiopia in 2008 . Two Kenyan runners set the current world records ; Eliud Kipchoge set the men 's record in Berlin in 2018 , with a time of 2 hours , 1 minute and 39 seconds , and the women 's world record of 2 hours , 14 minutes and 4 seconds was set by Brigid Kosgei in Chicago in 2019 . Kipchoge also became the first runner ever to break the two-hour barrier in a marathon , with a time of 1 hour , 59 minutes and 40 seconds , however this was in a controlled environment that included a supporting team and runners , and is not eligible for the official world record .
