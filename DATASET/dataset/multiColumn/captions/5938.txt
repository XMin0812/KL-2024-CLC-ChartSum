Between 1501 and 1866 , it is estimated that over 12.3 million people were forced onto ships in Africa , and transported to the Americas as slaves . Furthermore , it is estimated that only 10.5 million of these slaves disembarked on the other side of the Atlantic , meaning that roughly 1.8 million did not survive the journey . The transatlantic slave trade was a part of the triangular trade route between Europe , Africa and the Americas , during the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries . Generally speaking , this route saw European merchants bring manufactured products to Africa to trade for slaves , then transport the slaves to the Americas to harvest raw materials , before taking these materials back to Europe where they would then be consumed or used in manufacturing . Slavery was an integral part in funding the expansion of Europe 's colonial empires , which shaped the modern and highly globalized world in which we live today .
