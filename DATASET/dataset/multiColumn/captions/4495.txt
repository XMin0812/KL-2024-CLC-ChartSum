This statistic shows the total male and female population of Lithuania from 1950 to 2020 . From the graph we can see that there is a relatively large difference in the number of males and females , particularly when put in context with the total overall population . The number of women exceeds the number of men by over 260 thousand in 1950 , which is one of the long-term effects of the Second World War . During the war , Lithuania lost over 14 percent of its overall population , and the number of women was already higher than men before this , however the war caused this gap in population to widen much further . From 1950 onwards both male and female populations grow , and by 1990 the gap has shrunk down to 200 thousand people . In 1990 Lithuania gained it 's independence from the Soviet Union , and from this point both populations begin to decline , falling to 1.26 million men in 2020 , and 1.46 million women , with a difference of 200 thousand .
