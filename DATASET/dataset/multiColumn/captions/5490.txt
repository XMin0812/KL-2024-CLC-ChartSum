As of May 2020 , a total of 133 Olympic medals ( 42 gold , 43 silver and 48 bronze ) have been retroactively stripped from athletes for a variety of offences at the Summer Games . Most  of these offences were related to doping , usually where banned substances were found in urine samples , but also where athletes tampered with their urine sample or failed to provide a valid sample on time ( and a small number of non-doping related offences ) . The death of Danish cyclist Knud Enemark Jensen during the Team Time Trial in 1960 led to the formation of an Olympic medical committee in 1961 ; this committee then introduced drug testing at the Summer Olympics in 1968 . The first athlete to have a medal rescinded as a result of these tests was Hans-Gunnar Liljenwall in 1968 ; the Swede had two beers to calm his nerves before a shooting event , but had inadvertently consumed an illegal amount of alcohol . Since then , a number of other athletes ( or their horses ) have accidentally or unknowingly taken banned substances , but evidence suggests that a great deal more have done so intentionally and deceitfully . The first high-profile athlete to be stripped of their medal was Canada 's Ben Johnson , following his victory in the 100m sprint in 1988 . The scandal rocked the world of sport , was covered heavily by news outlets across the world , and increased public awareness and knowledge of the use of steroids in top-level sports .
