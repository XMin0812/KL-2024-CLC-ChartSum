The European housing , or residential real estate , market has recently shown clear signs of recovery , with an increasing house price being the main trend . In recent years , the housing market has continued to rise in the Netherlands due to low mortgage rates , a recovering economy and a high level of consumer confidence . For example , the average selling price of houses was higher in 2016 than in 2013 , when prices reached a low point . In 2017 , real estate prices are expected to increase with seven percent as a high number of sales , combined with an increasingly scarce supply , are expected to push the housing price up . In the four largest municipalities , the demand of housing outweighs the supply . In December 2016 , the average number of houses for sale in the municipality of Amsterdam was approximately 1,800 with this number reaching an average of 4,300 in December 2014 .
