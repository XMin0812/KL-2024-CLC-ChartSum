The experts at the Social Policy Institute at Higher School of Economics in Russia have estimated expected losses of social benefits funds as a consequence of the coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) expansion across the country . The value of revenue loss would grow exponentially at a longer duration of the crisis and at more elevated unemployment rates . Thus , if the crisis lasted six months and caused a loss of only five percent of workplaces , the estimated losses would be measured at over 390 billion Russian rubles .
