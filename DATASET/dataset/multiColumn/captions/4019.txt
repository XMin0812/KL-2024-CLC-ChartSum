Since the coronavirus outbreak in Poland ( March 4 , 2020 ) , the number of requests for designating pedestrian or car routes in the Apple Maps application has decreased on average by half compared to January 13 , 2020 . As of April 13 , Polish Apple Maps users sent 73 percent fewer requests for driving routes and 84 percent fewer requests for walking directions compared to the same period in January 2020 . The increased activity of Poles between mid-April and May results from changes introduced by the government to gradually restart the economy and lift restrictions related to the pandemic . Since 20 April , some rules concerning shopping , entering forests and parks , and the movement of young people over 13 years old have been loosened . On 4 May , the government decided to reopen shopping centers and hotels , libraries , and museums but introduced health and safety restrictions . Since 6 May , kindergartens and cr√®ches have been reopened . For further information about the coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) pandemic , please visit our dedicated Facts and Figures page .
