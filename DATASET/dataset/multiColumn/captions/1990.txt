In the 1824 U.S presidential election , which was the first where a popular vote was used to determine the overall winner , approximately three percent of the U.S. population voted in the election , while only one percent actually voted for the winner . Over the following decades , restrictions that prevented non-property owning males from voting were gradually repealed , and almost all white men over the age of 21 could vote by the 1856 election . The next major development was the 15th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution following the American Civil War , which granted suffrage to all male citizens of voting age , regardless of race . Turnout then grew to almost twenty percent at the turn of the century , however Jim Crow laws played a large part in keeping these numbers lower than they potentially could have been , by disenfranchising black communities in the south and undoing much of the progress made during the Reconstruction Era .
