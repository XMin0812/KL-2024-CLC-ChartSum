Part V of the Treaty of Versailles set strict limitations on the number of personnel allowed in each branch of the Germany army , and the number of weapons and ammunition allowed for each regiment . In total , there were 100,000 men allowed in the army , with just under 105,000 weapons and almost 60 million rounds of ammunition . The vast majority of these weapons was made up by rifles and carbines , which were the standard weapon for infantry or cavalry units , and their ammunition allowances combined to make up over two thirds of the total allowance . Machine guns were also allocated more than 15 million rounds of ammunition , while heavy guns and artillery received a much smaller allocation .
