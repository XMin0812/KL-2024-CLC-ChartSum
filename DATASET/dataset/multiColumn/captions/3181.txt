The District of Columbia is the only non-state entity of the United States with a share of electoral votes in U.S. presidential elections . Since the Twenty-third Amendment to the U.S. Constitution granted Washington D.C. representation in these elections , the nation 's capital has had three electoral votes in each election since 1964 . In these 15 elections , Washington D.C. 's citizens have chosen the overall winner seven times , giving a success rate of 47 percent , which is the lowest in the country . As of 2020 , no U.S. president has ever been born in Washington D.C. , although former Vice President and Democratic nominee in the 2000 election , Al Gore , is the only major party candidate to have been born there , during his father 's term in the House of Representatives .
