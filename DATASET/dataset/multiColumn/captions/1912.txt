Of the 40  men ( including Joe Biden ) who have been elected to the office of U.S. president , the average weight of U.S. presidents has been approximately 189lbs ( 86kg ) . The weight range has been between 122lbs ( 55kg ) and 332lbs ( 151kg ) , meaning that the heaviest president , William Howard Taft , was almost three times as heavy as the lightest president , James Madison ( who was also the shortest president ) . Although Taft weighed over 300lbs during his presidency in 1909 , he did implement a fitness and dietary regimen in the 1920s , that helped him lose almost 100lbs ( 45kg ) before his death due to cardiovascular disease in 1930 .
