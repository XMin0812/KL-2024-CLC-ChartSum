The graph shows the population of each continent from the year 1950 to 2020 . From the data we can see that the less developed continents of Asia and Africa grew at a much faster rate than the more developed continents of Europe and Oceania . Until 1995 the population of Europe was always larger than that of Africa , but by the end of the graph Africa 's population is over 0.6 billion people more than Europe 's ; meaning that Africa 's population has almost doubled in 25 years .
