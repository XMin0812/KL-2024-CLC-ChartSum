The discus throw has been a permanent feature for men at the Summer Olympics since the first modern Games in 1896 , while the women 's event has been present since 1928 . The sport dates back as far as the eighth century BCE , and it was re-popularized among students in Magdeburg , Germany in the 1870s ; today it remains one of the most iconic Olympic events due to its connection with the Ancient Olympic Games and ancient Greco-Roman artworks . The modern technique sees athletes rotate their bodies ( usually one and a half turns ) to throw a lenticular ( i.e . thicker in the middle than at the edges ) disc as far as possible along the field . For men , the disc weighs two kilograms and is 22cm in diameter , while it weighs one kilogram and is 18cm in diameter for women .
