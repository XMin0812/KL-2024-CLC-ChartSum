After the disruption caused by the coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) pandemic , Italian consumers seemed inclined to be loyal to the brands that they already knew and purchased before . However , opinions in this regard differ according to the age group . A survey from April 2020 showed that 44 percent of individuals between 55 and 64 years would do so , while only 28 percent of respondents aged between 25 and 34 years old showed the same intention . Unsurprisingly , over 80 percent of consumers appreciated brands offering promotions to their loyal customers .
