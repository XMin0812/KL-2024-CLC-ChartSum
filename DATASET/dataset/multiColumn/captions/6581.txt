In the build up to each US presidential election , primaries and caucuses are used by the major parties to nominate their candidate for the general election . A primary election is run by the state and local governments , whereas the caucuses are private events that are organized and administered by the respective parties . Primaries involve voters going to the ballot box to decide who their respective candidates will vote for in the respective national conventions . Most states conduct `` open primaries '' that are open to all eligible voters ; while a few states conduct `` closed primaries '' that are only open to party members . In contrast to this , caucuses involve party members meeting at events where they then discuss who they will vote for , although this system is gradually being phased out , with ten states switching from caucuses to primaries in 2016 .
