This statistic represents how people living in Catalonia use and perceive their languages according to a survey carried out in May 2014 . Although over 50 percent of respondents spoke only Spanish at home when growing up , in 2014 Catalan alone was the main language of communication for 46 percent of respondents . This , as well as the fact that 43 percent considered Catalan to be their own language , represents the growth in popularity of the regional language which has undeniably played a role in the cultural and national identity of Catalans and Catalonia .
