In the aftermath of the First World War , the League of Nations was established at the Paris Peace Conference of June 28 , 1919 , and the Covenant of the League of Nations made up Part I of the Treaty of Versailles . The League came into being on January 10 , 1920 , with the primary objective of preventing further global conflicts , by maintaining international peace and security through diplomacy and negotiation rather than military action , as well as a focus on the protection of human rights and international disarmament . Unfortunately for the League , the US Congress refused to join the League ( despite President Wilson being the leading architect behind the League 's founding ) , while the other Great Powers ( Britain , France , Italy and Japan ) were reluctant to provide military assistance or adhere to the economic sanctions put in place by the League . By the end of 1934 , League membership reached its highest level of 58 member states , however this was the year after the two primary aggressors of the Second World War , Germany and Japan , had left the League . Over the next decade , the rise of nationalism and the impact of the Second World War saw the inevitable collapse of the League of Nations , and its official dissolution in 1946 .
