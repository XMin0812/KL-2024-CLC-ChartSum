This statistic shows the expected sources of debt funding for real estate investments ( financing and refinancing ) in Europe as of 2020 . Debt financing takes place when the company strives to raise its working capital . In order to achieve that , it sells bonds , bills or notes to either institutional or individual investors . In that way investors become the creditors of the company and they can expect repayments of the debt plus interest . Debt investments are backed by a hard asset as collateral . Another way of raising capital is equity financing , in which case the company goes through the initial public offering of its stock on the stock exchange ; in this case investments are based on the estimated future performance of the company . As survey data showed , in 2020 approximately 54 percent of respondents , industry experts , expected a moderate increase in debt funding for real estate investments coming from alternative lending platforms at that time . Similarly , the same share of experts expected a moderate increase in debt financing from non-bank institutions .
