This statistic illustrates the market share of grocery stores in Great Britain from August 2012 to August 2019 . In the 12 weeks to August 11 , 2019 , Tesco 's market share stood at 27 percent . Compared to a corresponding period in previous years , Tesco has progressively lost its share , while the discounters Aldi and Lidl have both gained share every year over the same 12 week periods . Prior to the popularity of the discounters , the grocery retail market was dominated by the 'big four ' supermarkets : Tesco , Sainsbury 's , Asda and Morrisons . On the back of the economic recession and an inflation , however , consumer behavior has shifted in favor of cheaper alternatives and discount supermarkets . The resulting 'price wars ' has led to supermarkets lowering their prices and the highest share of food volume sales on promotion in Europe . Crucially , this has caused increased volatility in the grocery retail market and , as of January 2017 , Aldi overtook the Co-operative to become the fifth largest supermarket in the UK .
