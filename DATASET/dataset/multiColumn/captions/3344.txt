From 1920 until 1933 , there was a nationwide , constitutional ban on the production , distribution and sale of alcohol in the United States ( consumption , however , was not illegal ) . After a significant Prohibition movement that had lasted for almost a century , the US government voted on the issue in 1917 . The results show that the topic was not a partisan issue , as Republicans and Democrats voted very similarly in the Senate , and almost identically in the House of Representatives ( additionally , the candidates in the 1916 Presidential election made no mention of prohibition , to avoid alienating any voters ) . The topic had split the country for decades , however the impact of the First World War swung the momentum in favor of the 'drys ' _ , and Prohibition took effect in 1922 .
