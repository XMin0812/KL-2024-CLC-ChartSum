The Belgian labor market faced age and gender differences in 2019 . Despite gender equality being one of the fundamental principles of the European-Union law , the unemployment rate in Belgium was higher in the male population than in the female population . Furthermore , unemployment was higher in the young population , regardless of gender . In Belgium , a young male was not only more likely to be unemployed as someone older , but also when compared to a same-age female . The unemployment rate in Belgium was six percent in 2018 and was gradually decreasing since 2015 . However , the unemployment rate was unevenly spread throughout the country , some regions having a higher unemployment rate than others .
