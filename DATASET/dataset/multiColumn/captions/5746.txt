The 400 meter hurdles has featured in all but two Olympic Games as a men 's event , and in all Olympics since 1984 as a women 's event . Throughout this time , athletes from the United States have secured 18 out of 25 gold medals in the men 's event , while Jamaican and Russian athletes have taken the gold twice in the women 's event . Four men and one woman have won the gold medal twice , and the most recent to do so was Felix Sanchez of the Dominican Republic in 2004 and 2012 . Both the Olympic record and world record were set in 1992 by the US ' Kevin Young , with a time of 46.78 seconds , while the women 's Olympic record was set by Jamaica 's Melanie Walker in 2008 , with a time of 52.64 seconds , and the women 's world record was set in 2019 by the US ' Dalilah Muhammad , with a time of 52.16 seconds . In 2020 , the gold medallist in the women 's event in 2012 , Natalya Antyukh , was among four Russian athletes charged with doping offences ; if found guilty , then her victory will undoubtedly be nullified and the medals redistributed accordingly .
