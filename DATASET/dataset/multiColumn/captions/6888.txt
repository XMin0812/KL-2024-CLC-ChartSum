In November 2020 , compared to the previous year , there was a decrease in the employment in the enterprise sector in Poland . According to the source , this was a result of , inter alia , the reduction of the job number , termination and nonrenewal of fixed-term contracts ( sometimes due to the epidemiological situation ) , as well as termination of employment contracts with employees . On the other hand , the increase in the average gross salary reached its highest value since April 2020 .
