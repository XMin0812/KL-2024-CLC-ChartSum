The 2016 U.S. presidential election was contested by Donald J. Trump of the Republican Party , and Hillary Rodham Clinton of the Democratic Party . Clinton had been viewed by many as the most likely to succeed President Obama in the years leading up to the election , after losing the Democratic nomination to him in 2008 , and entered the primaries as the firm favorite . Independent Senator Bernie Sanders soon emerged as Clinton 's closest rival , and the popularity margins decreased going into the primaries . A few other candidates had put their name forward for the Democratic nomination , however all except Clinton and Sanders had dropped out by the New Hampshire primary . Following a hotly contested race , Clinton arrived at the Democratic National Convention with 54 percent of pledged delegates , while Sanders had 46 percent . Controversy emerged when it was revealed that Clinton received the support of 78 percent of Democratic superdelegates , while Sanders received just seven percent . With her victory , Hillary Clinton became the first female candidate nominated by a major party for the presidency . With seventeen potential presidential nominees , the Republican primary field was the largest in US history . Similarly to the Democratic race however , the number of candidates thinned out by the time of the New Hampshire primary , with Donald Trump and Ted Cruz as the frontrunners . As the primaries progressed , Trump pulled ahead while the remainder of the candidates withdrew from the race , and he was named as the Republican candidate in May 2016 . Much of Trump 's success has been attributed to the free media attention he received due to his outspoken and controversial behavior , with a 2018 study claiming that Trump received approximately two billion dollars worth of free coverage during the primaries alone .
