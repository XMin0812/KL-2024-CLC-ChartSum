Between 1910 and 1923 , as the First World War brought an end to the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Republic of Austria was established , the population in the region of present-day Austria fell by more than 100,000 people . When this decline is separated by gender , it becomes clear that the number of men fell by almost 140,000 between these years , primarily consisting of fatalities from the war . A similar trend can be observed before and after the Second World War , in which more than 350,000 Austrians perished , and this is again reflected in the difference in male and female populations between 1934 an 1950 . In 1950 , there were almost half a million more females than males in Austria , which had a total population of almost seven million at the time . Both populations grew from the 1950s until the late 1970s , but the populations then fell and plateaued throughout the 1980s due to a reduction in the number of foreign workers coming to the country , and the legalization of abortion and greater access to contraception ( there was also a period known as the 'pill-drop-off ' in the 1960s , where the birth rate decreased dramatically ) . By the late-1980s the population began to grow again , and the male to female ratio is growing much closer over time ; however , it has never been as close as it was before the First World War , and in 2020 , there are over 125,000 more females in Austria than males .
