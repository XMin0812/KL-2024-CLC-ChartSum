Florida was admitted to the union in 1845 , and has taken part in 43 U.S. presidential elections since this time . In these 43 elections , Florida has voted for the overall winner thirty times , giving a success rate of seventy percent . Since 1928 , Florida has voted for the winning candidate in 21 out of 24 elections , and is considered a key battleground state in modern elections . Florida has voted for a major party nominee in every election , backing the Republican nominee 17 times , Democrat 25 times , and the only time it did not vote Republican or Democrat was in 1848 when it voted for the Whig Party 's Zachary Taylor . Florida did not take part in the 1864 election due to its secession from the Union in the American Civil War , and like most other southern states it primarily voted Democrat until the mid-twentieth century , when it then started leaning more Republican . No U.S. President has ever been born in Florida , or resided there when taking office ; although Donald Trump declared himself a resident of Florida in 2019 , therefore making it his official home state during the 2020 election . The 2020 election in Florida proved to be a surprise for many , as Donald Trump won the popular vote by a 3.4 percent margin ; most polls had favored Biden going into election day , however intensive campaigning and increased Republican support among Cuban Americans has been cited as the reason for Trump 's victory in Florida .
