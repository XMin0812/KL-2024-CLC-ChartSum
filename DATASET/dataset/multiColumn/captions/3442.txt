China spends the most on oil refinery capacity additions out of any region worldwide . In 2019 , China 's investments in refinery capacity increases amounted to 21 billion U.S. dollars . This is unsurprising , given that China is home to the largest oil and gas company based on revenue in the world . In 2018 , Sinopec made some 432.5 billion U.S. dollars in revenues , while local competitor PetroChina ranked third with 347.7 billion U.S. dollars generated .
