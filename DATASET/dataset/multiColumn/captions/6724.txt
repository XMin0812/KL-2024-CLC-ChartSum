This statistic shows the total number of counterfeit euro banknotes and euro coins that were withdrawn from circulation in Germany from 2014 to 2019 . In 2014 , the number of removed counterfeit notes amounted to 63 thousand , mainly due to an increase in counterfeit activity related to the fifty euro note . It grew to 95.5 thousand by the end of 2015 , and decreased somewhat by the end of 2019 , to 55.2 thousand . The overall decline in counterfeit banknotes is in no small part due to the introduction of the new Europa series of enhanced anti-counterfeiting features that banknotes now have .
