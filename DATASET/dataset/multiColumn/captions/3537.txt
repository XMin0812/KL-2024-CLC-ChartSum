The Netherlands and cheese go hand in hand . Edammer , Maasdammer , Leerdammer and Oud Amsterdam are all well-known abroad , but the most famous Dutch cheese is without doubt Gouda . Named after the town Gouda in the province Zuid-Holland where it was predominantly traded for centuries , Gouda cheese and Dutch cheese have almost become synonyms nowadays .
