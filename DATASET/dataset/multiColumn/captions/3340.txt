The 1992 US presidential election was contested by incumbent President George H. W. Bush of the Republican Party , the Democratic Party 's Bill Clinton , and independent candidate Ross Perot . Bush won his party 's re-nomination easily , however the the nature of his opponents ( which included David Duke ; Grand Wizard of the Klu Klux Klan ) pushed him to take a more conservative approach throughout the remainder of his campaign , alienating many moderates in the process . Due to the Bush 's popularity following the US ' success in the Gulf War , many prominent Democrats decided not to run against him in the 1992 election , which meant that most of the candidates were relatively unknown . There was no clear frontrunner by the time of the first primary elections , but Clinton , despite widespread accusations of an extramarital affair , eventually secured the required number of delegates as the other candidates dropped out .
