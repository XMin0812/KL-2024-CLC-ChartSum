This graph shows the total population of the Confederate states of the US , from the censuses collected directly before and after the American Civil War . From the southern states we can see that the states with the least growth were South Carolina and Virginia , which grew by less than five thousand people in this ten year period . Virginia , particularly in 1863 , was devastated by the war , which would explain the limited growth . Texas experienced the largest amount of growth in this ten year period , which is due to westward expansion , immigration from Latin America , and the limited impact of the war in this area .
