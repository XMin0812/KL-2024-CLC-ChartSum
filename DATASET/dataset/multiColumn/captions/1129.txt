Volumes of coal imported and exported to and from the United Kingdom fluctuated throughout the years . Between 1970 and 2019 , coal import volumes tended to be higher than the amount of coal exported . However , another important trend noticed , is the reduction of coal volume in general , as with the growth of renewable energy sources and gas , coal has become less used as a fuel for electricity generation . In 2019 , the UK imported 6.5 million metric tons of coal and exported 740 thousand metric tons of coal .
