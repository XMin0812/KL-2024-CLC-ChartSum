The 1968 US presidential election was contested between Richard Nixon of the Republican Party , incumbent Vice-President Hubert Humphrey of the Democratic Party , and George Wallace of the newly-formed American Independent Party ( AIP ) . Incumbent President Lyndon B. Johnson withdrew from the Democratic race due to anti-Vietnam War sentiment across the country , and Robert Kennedy ( brother to the former President John F. Kennedy ) was one of the frontrunners until his assassination in June , 1968 , which cleared the way for Humphrey to win his party 's nomination . Richard Nixon ( vice president in the Eisenhower administration ) faced opposition from Nelson Rockefeller ( who had lost in the previous two Republican primaries ) and Ronald Reagan who emerged late in the race . Although Reagan was the most popular candidate in the Republican primaries , taking the most popular votes , Nixon 's success early in the campaign gave him the required number of delegates to take the Republican nomination . George Wallace ran for the AIP , who were a far-right party seeking to enforce racial segregation in the south .
