Demobilization following the First World War saw millions of soldiers return to their home countries from the trenches , and in doing so , they brought with them another wave of the deadliest and far-reaching pandemic of all time . As the H1N1 influenza virus , known as the Spanish Flu , spread across the world and infected between one third and a quarter of the global population , it impacted all areas of society . One such impact was on workers ' wages , as the labor shortage drove up the demand for skilled workers , which then increased wages . In the United States , wages had already increased due to the shortage of workers caused by the war , however the trend increased further in the two or three years after the war , despite the return of so many personnel from overseas . In the first fifteen years of the twentieth century , wages across the shown industries had increased gradually and steadily in line with inflation , with the hourly wage in manufacturing increasing from roughly 15 cents per hour to 21 cents per hour in this period . Between 1915 and 1921 or 1921 however , the hourly rate more than doubled across most of these industries , with the hourly wage in manufacturing increasing from 21 cents per hour in 1915 to 56 cents per hour in 1920 . Although manufacturing wages were the lowest among those shown here , the trend was similar across even the highest paying trades , with hourly wages in the building trade increasing from 57 cents per hour in 1915 to one dollar and eight cents in 1921 . The averages of almost all these trades decreased again in 1922 , before plateauing or increasing at a slower rate throughout the late 1920s . Other factors , such as the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and subsequent Great Depression , make comparing this data with wages in later decades more difficult , but it does give some insight into the economic effects of pandemics in history .
