In the mid-eighteenth century , the largest army in northern and western Europe belonged to France . During this time , France had a much larger population than all other European nations and states at this time ( and it had roughly double the population of Britain and Ireland combined ) . The army sizes in the 1740s increased greatly due to the War of Austrian Succession ( 1740 - 1748 ) , and again in the late 1750s because of the Seven Years War ( 1756 - 1763 ) . Although Britain was one of the strongest military powers of the 1700s , their army size was much smaller than the other 'Great Powers ' of Europe , however their naval strength was unparalleled during this time .
