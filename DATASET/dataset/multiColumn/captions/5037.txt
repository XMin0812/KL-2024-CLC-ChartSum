The U.S. presidential election has been held in North Carolina on 57 occasions ; this was every election except the first , in 1789 , and the 1864 election , when North Carolina was a member of the Confederate States of America . North Carolina has awarded all ( or at least a majority ) of its electoral votes to the nationwide winning candidate in 38 elections , giving a success rate of 67 percent . The `` Tar Heel State '' has voted for the Democratic nominee in thirty elections , and the Republican nominee in 15 ; although eleven of these have come in the past 14 elections . Despite North Carolina voting red in most elections since 1968 , it has often been seen as a battleground state , with the four most recent popular votes split by fewer than four points . In the 2020 election , North Carolina was on of the closest results nationwide , with Donald Trump winning the popular vote by a one percent margin .
