The statistic depicts the results of a survey about the average U.S. consumer spending during Christmas season , i.e . in the last 5 weeks of the year from 2008 to 2010 , by week . Even though the trend seems to indicate that people spent the most of their money in the first three weeks of December , in 2010 data differs slightly : spending has increased even more over the weeks with Christmas approaching more and more and consumers getting more eager - and maybe a little desperate - to find presents for their loved ones . While the respondents reported to have spent an average of 79 U.S. dollars in the last week of November 2010 , they spent an average of 85 U.S. dollars in the 4th week of December in 2010 .
