The rise of digital and contactless payments in the United Kingdom and Europe has seen the need for physical cash machines fall in recent years . Between June and December of 2019 , almost 1.7 thousand ATM 's closed in the UK . High street banking giants such as Natwest and Barclays closed approximately 400 each between December 2017 and December 2019 . This decline is likely in response to the increase of cashless payments and the drop in withdrawals .
