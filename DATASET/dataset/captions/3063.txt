Kieskeurig.nl was the most well-known price comparison website in the Netherlands , according to a survey from 2017 ( the only one held in the country about this topic ) . 84 percent of Dutch consumers knew the website for retail prices and product reviews . The insurance comparison website Independer.nl was also a familiar name . Noticeable , however , is the low familiarity among Dutch consumers of relatively big websites , such as HoyHoy and Easyswitch . According to the source this has to do with a certain distrust : are these websites actually independent and are they offering the best deal possible ? This potential distrust in online companies is not uncommon in the Netherlands and can also be seen , for example , in the level of ( dis ) trust the Dutch have towards social media .
