Life expectancy in Afghanistan remained below thirty in the nineteenth century , and it was not until the mid-1900s that life expectancy increased at a significantly higher rate , and by 2020 , Afghanistan 's life expectancy is expected to be just over 64 years . A noticeable drop in life expectancy appeared between 1915 and 1920 , as the Spanish Flu epidemic that swept the globe impacted the population of Afghanistan severely . ( A second drop can be observed in the early 1950s , however this is due to contrasting sources , as more recent data from the UN becomes available ) . Despite continuous war in the country since the late 1970s , medical advancements have brought Afghanistan 's life expectancy closer to the global average in recent decades .
