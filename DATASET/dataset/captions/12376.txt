In the fiscal year 2019/2020 , carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) emissions in India fell by an estimated 30 million tonnes of CO2 ( MtCO2 ) . This was the first time emissions had fallen in the country in four decades , with a drop of three MtCO2 last occurring in 1982 . Although factors such as renewable energy growth and economic slowdown affected these figures , measures , such as lockdowns , implemented to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) had a big impact in early 2020 . According to the source , March of 2020 experienced an estimated 15 percent drop in emissions when compared to the previous year .
