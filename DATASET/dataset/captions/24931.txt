The child mortality rate in Russia , for children under the age of five , was 419 deaths per thousand births in 1855 . This translated into roughly 42 percent of all children born in 1855 not surviving past the age of five , and it remained above forty percent until the early twentieth century . Since then it has fallen consistently and it is expected to fall to its lowest recorded figure , at just seven deaths per thousand people in the period between 2015 and 2020 . The spike in child mortality seen in the period between 1950 and 1955 is likely due to conflicting sources .
