The fertility rate of a country is the average number of children that women from that country will have throughout their reproductive years . From 1800 until 1865 , Japan 's fertility rate grew quite gradually , from 4.1 children per woman , to 4.8 . From this point the fertility rate drops to 3.6 over the next ten years , as Japan became more industrialized . Towards the end of the nineteenth century , Japan 's fertility rate grew again , and reached it 's highest recorded point in the early 1920s , where it was 5.4 children per woman . Since this point it has been gradually decreasing until now , although it did experience slight increases after the Second World War , and in the early 1970s . In recent decades Japan 's population has aged extensively , and today , Japan has the second oldest population and second highest life expectancy in the world ( after Monaco ) . In contrast to this , Japan has a very low birth rate , and it 's fertility rate is expected to fall below 1.4 children per woman in 2020 .
