In 2018 , APG listed as the biggest asset manager coming from the Benelux region ( Belgium , Luxembourg and the Netherlands ) . Worldwide assets under management ( AUM ) of the Dutch company , which manages pension funds , were valued at roughly 460,000 million U.S. dollars . Asset managers from the Netherlands overall reached a higher AUM than those from Belgium or Luxembourg . A reason for this could be that the Netherlands overall had a higher number of asset management companies than Belgium . Luxembourg had the highest number of companies , though , but it is likely that most of these come from outside the Grand Duchy .
