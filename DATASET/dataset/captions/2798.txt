In 2020 , the average age in the Philippines is expected to reach 25.7 years , increasing to roughly 35 years of age by 2050 . This is a significant rise , considering that until the year 2000 , the country 's median age was under 20 years old . From 2007 to 2017 , the share of very young people decreased , while the age brackets for people aged 15 - 64 and 65 or older grew . This shift in age structure implies a lower birth rate , as well as an aging population .
