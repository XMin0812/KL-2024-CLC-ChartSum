The state of Tamil Nadu in 2018 had about 67.6 percent of households with exclusive access to toilets . These results come from the 76th NSO survey conducted between July and December 2018 , which found over 20 percent of households across the country with no access to any kind of toilets . One of the goals of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan , a clean India campaign launched by the Modi government , aimed to eliminate open defecation in the country by building toilets . Since 2014 , 80 million toilets were built , making 419 districts in the country free from open defecation .
