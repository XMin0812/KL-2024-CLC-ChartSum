From October to March , Venice experiences repeated flood events . Over this period , seasonal and local winds , combined with other meteorological phenomena , can interfere with the tidal reflux in the Venetian Lagoon . While most flood events have limited impact , in some cases they can bring exceptionally high water levels . Among all recorded events where the water level exceeded 110 cm ( 3.6 feet ) , 94 occurred in November . In November 2019 , Venice experienced the second highest tide since 1872 , when flood records started , reaching a peak of 187 cm ( 6.1 feet ) above sea level .
