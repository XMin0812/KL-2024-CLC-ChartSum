The issue of race and slavery was arguably the largest cause of the American Civil War , with the southern states seceding from the Union as the practice of slavery became increasingly threatened . From the graph we can see that roughly 16.5 percent of the entire US population at this time was black , and the vast majority of these were slaves . In 1860 there were almost 27 million white people , four and a half million black people , and less than one hundred thousand non-black or white people ( mostly of Native/Latin American or East-Asian origin ) .
