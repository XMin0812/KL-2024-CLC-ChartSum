Housing prices in Belgium are expected to increase in 2020 due to the coronavirus , with a much larger decrease expected in 2021 . For 2020 , a house price decrease of three percent year-on-year is expected , which is a more positive outlook than in earlier months ( when a correction in house prices of three percent y-o-y for 2020 was forecast ) . Consumers signal much uncertainty on , for example , unemployment in Belgium , which might hamper the housing market in 2021 .
