This statistic shows the share of the total votes received by each party in the UK general election of May 7 , 2015 . In what turned out to be a majority win for the Conservative party , few will be surprised to see the blue bar at the top of this chart . What is perhaps most noteworthy is that UKIP was in third place in terms of votes despite only securing one seat . This is due to the 'first past the post ' system which only looks at which candidate received the most votes in the individual constituencies and awards seats accordingly . The election result has reignited calls from some corners to implement the 'proportional representation ' system which would have meant UKIP and the Green Party , for example , would have won 13 and 4 seats respectively as opposed to each winning one .
