In Denmark , the number of reported criminal offences fluctuated in recent years . In 2019 , the number amounted to almost 500 thousand crimes , and among these , there were about 6.5 thousand sexual crimes . In regards to the victims , the vast majority was female . According to the Istanbul Convention , officially valid in Denmark since 2014 , rape and all other non-consensual acts of a sexual nature must be classified as criminal offences . Nevertheless , there is no clear definition of rape in Danish law . It is only based on whether physical violence , threat , or coercion is involved or whether the victim was unable to resist .
