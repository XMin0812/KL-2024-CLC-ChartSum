The amount of fuel used to generate electricity depends on the efficiency of the power plant and the heat content of the fuel . Heat rate measures the efficiency of a generator or power plant and is based on the amount of energy used to generate one kilowatt of electricity . Heat rates ( power plant efficiencies ) depend on generator type , power plant emission controls , and some other factors . One metric ton of coal can generate 1,927 kilowatt hours of electricity , in comparison to 1,000 cubic feet of natural gas which can generate 99 kilowatt hours .
