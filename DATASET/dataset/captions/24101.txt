A constitutional referendum on the number of parliament members was held in Italy on September 20 and 21 , 2020 . According to a survey conducted at the beginning of September 2020 , 51 percent of respondents declared that they intend to vote in favor to cut the number of parliament members . The Italian Parliament consists of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate of the Republic . Before the referendum , the number of deputies amounts to 630 , while senators are 315 . In case the referendum will approve the cut , the reform will reduce the number of deputies to 400 and senators to 200 . In absolute numbers , Italy has one of the highest number of parliament members in Europe . However , in proportion to the population , this figure is low . Data on the number of deputies in the European Union and in the United Kingdom show that Italy currently has one of the lowest parliament member rates among all countries . After the referendum , Italy could potentially have just 0.7 members in the Chamber of Deputies per 100,000 population , ranking last in the EU .
