The coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) outbreak caused massive troubles in Italy . The resilience of the Italian healthcare system and the limited capacity of hospitals were among the most challenging issues facing authorities . As the graph shows , the spread of the virus put hospitals and medical staff under a lot of pressure . Since the beginning of April , when the first peak of 29 thousand hospitalized individuals ( except ICU ) was recorded , this figure decreased gradually . However , it started increasing again in mid-August and on November 11 it surpassed the first-wave peak . As of January 5 , 2021 , 23,174 patients were hospitalized in Italy because of COVID-19 . The highest figure since the start of the pandemic was registered on November 23 , 2020 , when 34,697 individuals were being treated in hospitals for COVID-19-related reasons .
