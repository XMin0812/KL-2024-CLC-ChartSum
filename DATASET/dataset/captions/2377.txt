In 2019 , Avengers : Endgame overtook 2009 's Avatar as the highest grossing film of all time at the international Box Office . As of 2020 , the difference between Endgame and Avatar 's totals is fewer than ten million dollars , however this may change over the next few years as Avatar is likely to be shown again in theaters prior to midnight releases of it 's four sequels ( the first of which is due in 2022 ) . Before Avatar , the record had been held by 1997 's Titanic ( both of which were directed by James Cameron ) . When adjusted for inflation , 1939 's Gone With the Wind is the highest grossing film of all time , with some sources claiming that it has generated approximately 3.4 billion dollars in today 's money    . The highest grossing film of 2020 was The Eight Hundred , which took over 460 million dollars worldwide ; the first ever non-Hollywood production to feature on this list . The significant drop off in global revenues in 2020 was due to the Covid-19 pandemic , which saw the closure of thousands of movie theaters across the world ; although the varying restrictions per country eventually saw Asian markets overtake North American and European markets as the largest worldwide , and five of the ten highest grossing films in 2020 were either Chinese or Japanese productions . Additionally , many major Hollywood releases have been delayed until 2021 or beyond , while a significant number of films had their theatrical release cancelled and were instead released via online streaming services ; it remains to be seen what the long-term impact of the pandemic will be on the entertainment industry , or the extent of the economic damage caused to movie theaters around the world .
