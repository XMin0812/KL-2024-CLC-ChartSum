Over 50 thousand restaurants registered for the UK government 's 'Eat Out to Help Out Scheme ' in July and August 2020 . At the time the scheme ended on August 31 , approximately 84,700 individual restaurant premises were registered . The discount scheme was an incentive set up to help businesses attract customers following the UK lockdown due to the coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) pandemic . The scheme encouraged people to eat out at restaurants by offering them discounts on certain days of the week , which they could then claim back from the government .
