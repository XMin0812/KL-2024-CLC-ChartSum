Private sector debt includes the stock of liabilities , debt securities and loans , held by non-financial corporations , households and non-profit institutions serving households . Between 1995 and 2018 , the value of non-consolidated debt of the private sector in the United Kingdom ( UK ) increased steadily , reaching its highest value of nearly 3.5 trillion British pounds in 2018 . In 2019 , this figure decreased slightly . Indebtedness is correlated with rising income levels since borrowing allows an increase in consumption and investment . Nevertheless , overborrowing exposes businesses to risk of changes in economic conditions , interest rates and inflation .
