The cost to income ratio ( C/I ratio ) is an important financial metric in determining the profitability of banks . The measure looks at the cost of running operations as to a bank 's operating income . Lower ratios mean that a bank is running more profitably whereas a higher C/I ratio indicates that the bank 's operating expenses are too high .
