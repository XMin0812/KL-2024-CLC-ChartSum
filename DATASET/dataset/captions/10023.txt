The app can be used by anybody in the Netherlands , not only clients from ABN Amro . iDEAL is covered by all major Dutch consumer banks ands allows consumers to use their bank account for online purchases . In 2017 , iDEAL processed 378 million online payments . When compared to other European countries , cash money was used the least in the Netherlands .
