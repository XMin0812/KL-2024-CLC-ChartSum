In Canada , the crude birth rate in 1860 was forty live births per thousand people , meaning that four percent of the population had been born in that year . From this point until the turn of the century , the crude birth rate decreases gradually , to just over thirty births per thousand . Over the next twenty years , this number hovers just below thirty , and thereafter it decreases much more rapidly than before , to 20.7 in 1940 , before Canada 's baby boom in the 1940s , 50s and 60s , where the birth rate increased to over 27 . From the end of the baby boom until the late 1970s the population decreases rapidly again , before the rate of decline then slows . Since 1975 , the crude birth rate of Canada will have dropped from 15.6 , to it 's lowest point in 2020 , where it is expected to be just 10.5 births per thousand people .
