This statistic shows a distribution of consumers according to their attitudes to environmentally friendly products in the United Kingdom ( UK ) in 2014 . Using survey data , TNS applied a segmentation analysis identifying consumers into four groups in terms of their attitudes to green issues and environmentally friendly products . The results showed that 27 percent of UK consumers are 'concerned citizens ' _ , that is , they are willing to pay for environmentally friendly products but not 100 percent convinced by how effective they are . The smallest of the four segments were the issue sceptics , with 19 percent believing the dangers to the environment are overstated .
