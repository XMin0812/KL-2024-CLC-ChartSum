Inflation in Myanmar dropped to a five-year low in 2017 , settling at 4.62 percent . This is down from a fairly high spike in 2016 , expected to converge to a steady state around 6 percent in the coming years . For a developing economy , this is an acceptable level , though Myanmar 's central bankers would probably prefer one or two percentage points less .
