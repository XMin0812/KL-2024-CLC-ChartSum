The price of cigarettes has substantially increased each year since 2000 . In 2015 , the recommended retail price of a 20 pack of cigarettes was 9.16 British pounds . As of 2017 , the most expensive country in which to purchase cigarettes in Europe was the United Kingdom . Cigarette prices across Europe are driven by the respective taxes imposed within each of the member states and consist of a specific duty per 1,000 cigarettes and an ad valorem rate onto the recommended retail price , in addition to value added tax ( VAT ) . Thus the highest rates of taxation are reflected in the retail prices . Similar rates of taxation between countries are also found for hand rolling tobacco , where the highest levels of taxation are found in the United Kingdom once again . Governments that impose such strong barriers to the purchasing of tobacco are considered 'nanny states ' _ , with high levels of control on other factors , such as advertising , bans of tobacco products on retail displays and graphic warnings on cigarette packs .
