Textile was one of the hardest hit retail sectors during the coronavirus pandemic . In many European countries , retail shops selling textiles , clothing , and footwear closed down as part of the lockdown protocols , and only resumed businesses starting from May . Naturally , compared to other retail sectors , textiles made the most intense comeback in terms of sales volumes . Compared with April 2020 , textile retail volume grew by over 284 percent in September 2020 in the European Union .
