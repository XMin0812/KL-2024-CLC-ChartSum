In 2019 , there were over 45.8 thousand writers and authors working in the United States , up very slightly from the previous year and still markedly higher than the figure recorded back in 2011 . Many changes have occurred for employees in this sector over the last few years , and it is a truth universally acknowledged that writing for a living is no mean feat . In fact , a 2018 survey revealed that just 21 percent of full-time published authors made one hundred percent of their income from books . The majority of professional U.S. writers admitted that they pursued other writing-related activities on top of their book writing work in order to earn money . Additionally , median royalty income for authors who were traditionally published by a commercial or academic publisher dropped by one thousand U.S. dollars between 2013 and 2017 . By contrast , self-published authors saw an impressive increase in their royalty income , and along with romance/romantic suspense authors were the only ones to see a positive change in this regard . On the other side of the spectrum are the few globally renowned authors who got their big break , and who make millions of dollars per year .
