The fertility rate of a country is the average number of children that women from that country will have throughout their reproductive years . From 1800 to 1900 , Norway 's fertility rate fluctuated quite regularly , between 3.9 and 4.9 children per woman , and then in the first half of the twentieth century it declined gradually , falling to 1.9 in 1940 . From 1940 until 1970 , Norway experienced its 'baby boom ' and the fertility rate rose to almost 3 children per woman in this time , before falling again to 1.7 in 1985 . From this point onwards , the fertility rate has plateaued , between 1.7 and 1.9 , and is expected to be 1.7 in 2020 .
