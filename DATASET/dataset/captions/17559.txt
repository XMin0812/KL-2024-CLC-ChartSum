The Nigerian anti-social media bill , officially titled Protection from Internet Falsehood and Manipulations Bill 2019 , has caused controversy in Nigeria , where it has been perceived by some as a method of control and restriction of freedom of speech and press . The bill proposes fines of 825 U.S. dollars ( around 300 thousand Nigerian naira ) for individuals found guilty of knowingly lying or spreading false information online , and for companies and media outlets the fines could amount to 27.5 thousand U.S. dollars .
