Austria : Cisleithania was the Austrian-ruled section of the Austro-Hungarian Empire . This graphic shows the total population of Austria : Cisleithania from 1818 until 1910 , just before the outbreak of World War I . As we can see from the graph , the population grows rather gradually throughout this 92 year period . The only dip in population comes between 1846 and 1851 , possibly as a result of the revolutions that took place in 1848 . After this time the population continues to grow before reaching over 28.5 million people in 1910 . The later stages of the Austro-Hungarian Empire 's history were marked by a period of internal tensions between the varying ethnic groups , as the ethnic Slavs , Czechs and Romance groups felt oppressed by the ruling Germanic and Magyar peoples . The Empire was then dissolved in 1918 following its defeat during the First World War , and a number of new states were formed in the aftermath .
