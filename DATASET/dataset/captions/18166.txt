The infant mortality rate in Germany , for children under the age of one ( twelve months ) , was 295 deaths per thousand births in 1840 . This translated into approximately three out of every ten children born in 1840 not surviving past their first birthday . The largest decrease in this 180 year period came in the late 1870s , as Germany introduced mandatory vaccination for children , which brought infant mortality down by almost sixty in this five year period . From the turn of the twentieth century onwards , the infant mortality rate in Germany dropped considerably ( although data in and immediately after the Second World War is not available ) , and by 2020 the number is expected to be just three deaths per thousand births .
