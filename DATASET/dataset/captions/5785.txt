The fertility rate of a country is the average number of children that women from that country will have throughout their reproductive years . In Germany in 1800 , the average woman of childbearing age would have 5.4 children over the course of their lifetime . It remained around this number until the late 1820s , when it then dropped to just under five , which was a long-term effect of the Napoleonic Period in Europe . From this point until the end of the nineteenth century , Germany 's fertility rate was rather sporadic , reaching it 's lowest point in 1855 with an average of 4.6 births per woman , and it 's highest point in 1875 ( just after the foundation of the German Empire in 1871 ) , with an average of 5.4 live births per woman . From the beginning of the twentieth century until the end of the Second World War , Germany 's fertility rate dropped from around 5 children per woman in 1900 , to 1.9 in 1945 . The only time where the fertility rate increased was in the inter-war years . Like other countries heavily involved in the Second World War , Germany ( both East and West ) experienced a Baby Boom from the late 1940s to the late 1960s , however it then dropped to it 's lowest point of just 1.3 children per woman by 1995 , shortly after the re-unification of Germany . In recent years , Germany 's fertility rate has gradually been increasing again , and is expected to reach 1.6 in 2020 , its highest rate in over forty years .
