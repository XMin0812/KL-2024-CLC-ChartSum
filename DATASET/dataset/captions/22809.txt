This statistic illustrates the opinion of the Italian adult population concerning NGOs involved in migrant rescue operations as of August 2017 . According to the survey results , the opinion of four in ten Italians was negatively affected by the issuing of the Code of Conduct for NGO rescue boats and by the recent judiciary investigations about illegal immigration . By contrast , around one in ten respondents ( 12 percent ) held now a more positive opinion of NGOs . The 11-point code is aimed at regulating operations in the sea where the Italian coast guard , European border patrol forces and nine NGOs currently operate vessels which rescue stranded migrants .
