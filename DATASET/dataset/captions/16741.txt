Bolivia is one of the few Latin American countries whose monetary policy rates have decreased in the last five years . Monetary policy rate , also known as base interest rate or base rate , is a percentage defined by central banks to determine the cost of credit in a given economy . This indicator serves as a guide for other financial institutions to set their own interest rates . In 2018 , the Bolivian Central Bank set the monetary policy rate at 2.5 percent , slightly up from 2.38 percent a year earlier .
