The fertility rate of a country is the average number of children that women from that country will have throughout their reproductive years . In 1800 , Australian women of childbearing age would go on to have approximately 6.5 children on average over the course of their lifetime , and this number decreased gradually to just below five in the early 1850s . Over the next ten years the fertility rate increased to 5.7 children per woman , as an influx of migrants arrived on the continent during the Australian gold rushes , however the fertility rate dropped from 1860 until 1935 , when it was then just 2.2 children per woman , although there was a small baby boom after the First World War . Australia 's fertility rate did rise during the global 'Baby Boom ' after the Second World War , reaching 3.4 in the 1960s , but it then dropped to two children per woman in 1980 , and it has plateaued just under this number until today .
