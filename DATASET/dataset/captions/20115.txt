As of June 2020 , the Instagram account of the International Skating Union ( ISU ) had 240,000 followers . The 2019 - 2020 ISU Grand Prix season will began on July 1 , 2019 , and end on June 30 , 2020 . The first Grand Prix event of the season was the Junior Grand Prix ( JGP ) France in Courchevel , France , on August 21 to 24 . In January 2020 , several young skaters competed in the 2020 Youth Olympic Games in Lausanne , Switzerland . The season came to an untimely end due to the global COVID-19 pandemic as the 2020 World Championships in Montreal and all subsequent competitions were cancelled by either the ISU , the host federation , or the local governments . The future of the 2020 - 2021 skating season is still unclear as several of the Junior Grand Prix , which traditionally open the season , have already been cancelled .
