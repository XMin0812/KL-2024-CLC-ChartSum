The fertility rate of a country is the average number of children that women from that country will have throughout their reproductive years . From 1850 until 1910 , Italy 's fertility rate dropped from 5.5 children per woman to 4.4 , and over the next fifty years it dropped a lot more sharply , fluctuating along the way . By 1920 it had dropped to 3.3 , as a result of the First World War and the economic turmoil that followed . The interwar years saw some fluctuation , but overall the fertility rate dropped to just 2.6 in 1945 . In the 75 years that have followed the war , Italy 's fertility rate has followed previous trends , where there are some periods of increase , but overall it declined . In the late 1900s Italy had one of the lowest fertility rates in the world , at just 1.2 children per woman in 200 , although this has increased slightly in the past two decades , and is expected to be just over 1.3 in 2020 .
