The coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) pandemic is expected to have a significant negative impact on Kenya 's economy . For 2020 , the real Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) growth is estimated at 1.5 percent . With a central role in East Africa , the country had an economy deceleration already before the novel virus . In 2019 , the GDP growth was measured at 5.4 percent , down from 6.3 percent in 2018 . The COVID-19 shock is foreseen to have large impacts on services , industry , and agriculture . As of December 5 , 2020 , there were more than 87 thousand confirmed cases in Kenya . Two estimations were published by the source on 2020 . The first estimated GDP growth scenario assumes that the economy will recover relative quickly . Specifically , the prediction is done on a baseline of well targeted policy response to corona and also of normal weather , supportive of agricultural output . An adverse scenario , with significant supply and demand shocks , puts Kenya in recession for 2020 , with an expected negative one percent rate of GDP growth . COVID-19 will affect dramatically the economy in East Africa . The GDP in the region was revised downwards from 5.1 percent to 1.2 percent in a baseline scenario ( when the virus is contained by the third quarter of 2020 ) , and to 0.2 percent in a worst-case scenario ( when COVID-19 persists to the end of 2020 ) . Before the health crisis , all East African countries were expected to have a positive growth , except for Sudan due to conflicts .
