Global installed electricity capacity for fossil fuels was about 4.15 terawatts in 2017 , compared to 1.01 terawatts of installed renewable capacity . Electricity generation from fossil fuels has consistently decreased over the last few years , whereas renewable electricity generation has , in turn , increased to meet demand . Renewable sources now account for almost 27 percent of global electricity generation . The cost of renewable sources has decreased over time , making them increasingly more cost effective and more common around the world . As renewable technologies become more feasible in electricity generation , these sources gradually replace conventional fossil fuel sources .
