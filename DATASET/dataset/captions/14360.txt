On the weekend of January 1 to 3 , 2021 , the drama 'Den st√∏rste forbrytelsen ' ( over 11 thousand admissions ) was the most viewed cinema movie in Norway . In second and third place came the animated movie 'Arctic Dogs ' and the Norwegian family film 'Dragevokterens jul ' _ . Due to a renewed rise of coronavirus cases in the country - especially in Oslo - many public venues have been closed , including cinemas in the capital . As a consequence , admission numbers were relatively low . Although the cinema ticket prices increased in the last years - on average from 86.57 Norwegian kroner in 2010 to 115.4 Norwegian kroner in 2019 , admissions in Norwegian cinemas remained stable and in 2019 , the number of moviegoers amounted to roughly 11.29 million . Based on admissions , the leading cinema chain in Norway was ODEON in the mentioned year , with a market share of 29.8 percent , followed by Nordisk Film Kino ( 27.2 percent ) and Kinoalliansen ( 14.8 percent ) .
