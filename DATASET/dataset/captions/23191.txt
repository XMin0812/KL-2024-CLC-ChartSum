Humans have been living on the continent of Australia ( name derived from `` Terra Australis '' ; Latin for `` the southern land '' ) for approximately 65,000 years , however population growth was relatively slow until the nineteenth century . Europeans had made some contact with Australia as early as 1606 , however there was no significant attempt at settlement until the late eighteenth century . By 1800 , the population of Australia was approximately 350,000 people , and the majority of these were Indigenous Australians . As colonization progressed the number of ethnic Europeans increased while the Australian Aboriginal population was decimated through conflict , smallpox and other diseases , with some communities being exterminated completely , such as Aboriginal Tasmanians .
