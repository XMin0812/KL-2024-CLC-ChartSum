Part VIII of the Treaty of Versailles dealt with the reparations owed by Germany to the Allied powers of the First World War . Although the treaty did not specify the final numbers owed by the German government ( which was left to the Reparations Commission ) , it did include the amount of coal that Germany was instructed to pay to Belgium , France , Italy and Luxembourg annually over a ten year period . Although Belgium was to receive eight million tons of German coal per year , the largest amount was to go to France . While France 's fixed figure was just seven million tons per year , the German government was also required to give France the difference of how much coal was produced in the Nord and Pas de Calais region , and how much would have been there had much of the area not been destroyed in the war ( although never in excess of twenty million tons ) . In addition to this , specifications were also made for benzol , coal tar and sulfate of ammonia reparations to be paid to France . Italy received an average of 7.7 million tons per year , ( although the first five installments differed in quantity ) , while Germany was ordered to pay Luxembourg an equal amount to their annual pre-war consumption .
