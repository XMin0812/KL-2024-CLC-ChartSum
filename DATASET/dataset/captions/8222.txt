Along with varying word counts and numerous locations , William Shakespeare 's plays also have wide ranging numbers of characters in each play . The range in the number of characters with spoken parts in Shakespeare 's plays is as little as 17 , in The Two Gentlemen of Verona , to as much as sixty , in Henry VI : Part Two . There is an average of almost 34 characters per play.There is some correlation between the word count , number of speeches and number of characters , as the majority of plays that have above-average word counts are also above average in the other graphs , although this correlation is not very strong as there is no play that is in the top five of these three lists , and only one play ( The Comedy of Errors ) is in the bottom five of all three lists .
