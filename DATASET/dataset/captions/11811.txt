Consumers in the Netherlands were the first in the world to try out the new Disney Plus ( stylized as Disney+ ) streaming service . Starting Wednesday September 11 ( Android ) and Friday September 13 ( iOS ) , Dutch residents were able to sign up for free for an early version before its release in the US , Canada and the Netherlands on November 12 . Thanks to figures provided by Airnow PLC , it is possible to get an idea of how the new video streaming service launched in the European country . In the first week ( from September 13 up until September 20 ) , the Disney+ app reached nearly 200,000 downloads . The source does not mention whether one download equals single person use or whether multiple persons in a household , such as children , use the app alongside their parents . In 2018 , there were around 7.8 million households in the Netherlands .
