Stock prices of Unilever , part of the AEX stock exchange in the Netherlands , decreased by over a quarter between February and March 2020 , but has since recovered to be around 10 percent lower than its February peak as of December 2020 . This was partly caused by concerns over the coronavirus outbreak , as consumer demand could decrease and industries possibly face the effects of a looming recession in 2020 . First estimates forecast that the Dutch economy , for example , could see its growth slow down significantly due to the new virus . As of January 8 , 2021 the stock price of Unilever stood at 49.35 euros , roughly five euros less than the price in February 2020 .
