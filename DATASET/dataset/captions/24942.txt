Bulgaria 's fertility rate in the late nineteenth century fluctuated between 4.8 and 5.2 births per woman , before rising as high as 5.8 in the early 1900s ; this means that Bulgarian woman of childbearing age in 1905 would have an average of almost six children throughout their lifetime . From this point until 1970 , Bulgaria 's fertility rate dropped consistently , and reached 2.1 births per woman at the beginning of the decade . There was a slight increase in the 1970s , however the fertility rate then dropped to its lowest ever level of 1.2 births per woman at the turn of the millennium . Since this point , Bulgaria 's fertility rate has increased and reached 1.6 births per woman in 2020 ; despite this increase in fertility rate , Bulgaria 's population continues to fall due to a large emigration rate and falling birth rate .
