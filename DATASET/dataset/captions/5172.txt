In August 2020 , there were 281.5 million unique monthly visitors to music streaming service Spotify worldwide , up from 215.5 million in August 2019 . Whilst the number remained relatively stable for some time , 2019 was not as good as year for Spotify when it came to unique web visitors as 2018 , with the number dropping below 220 million for several consecutive months . However , by 2020 , music lovers all over the world found themselves in lockdown due to the coronavirus , which will likely have contributed to the increased web visits year on year .
