The child mortality rate in Finland , for children under the age of five , was 420 deaths per thousand births in 1800 . This means that for every thousand babies born in 1800 , roughly 42 percent did not make it to their fifth birthday . Over the course of the next 220 years , this number has dropped drastically , and the rate has dropped to its lowest point ever in 2020 where it is just seven deaths per thousand births , which is the lowest of any country n the world . Since 1800 , the child mortality rate in Finland has dropped gradually , particularly since the turn of the twentieth century , and the only time since 1900 where the mortality rate increased was between 1915 and 1920 , as a result of the Spanish Flu pandemic that swept across the globe .
