Life expectancy in Algeria was approximately 29 years in 1845 , and over the past 175 years it has increased to almost 77 years . It is assumed that a global influenza pandemic reduced life expectancy to 24 years in 1850 , and the combination of famine and the fourth cholera pandemic caused Algerian life expectancy to fall below twenty years in 1870 . The next decrease came after 1915 , and while the First World War definitely contributed to the drop , the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918 ( which was spread by the war ) was the biggest contributor to lower life expectancy . During the Second World War , Algeria was controlled by the Axis powers until the Operation Torch that began late in 1942 , when the allies started driving them away . During this time , Algeria 's life expectancy fell from 36 to 34 years . Since 1950 , Algeria 's life expectancy has continuously increased , despite the Algerian War of Independence and Algerian Civil War . The largest increase in life expectancy came in the early 1980s , during a period of relative peace in Algeria , and in 2020 , Algeria 's life expectancy is more than double what it was before the Second World War .
