First released on March 10 , 2020 , Call of Duty : Warzone is a multiplayer battle royale game which pits up to 150 players against one another . On the first day of its release , the Activision game hit six million players , a figure which grew to over 75 million players by the end of its first five months on the market . This staggering growth is no doubt in part due to the coronavirus pandemic which spread across the world at the beginning of 2020 . As millions of people were encouraged and , in some cases , legally required to stay at home , many people turned to video gaming as a form of entertainment .
