The fertility rate of a country is the average number of children that women from that country will have throughout their reproductive years . From 1800 until today , Poland 's fertility rate has gradually declined , however it was very sporadic along the way . Poland 's fertility rate reached it 's highest point in the early 1860s , where it was 6.4 children per woman . Between 1795 and the end of the First World War there was no official country of Poland , and this is a tumultuous time in the area 's history , and many different factors would have affected the fertility rate . In the Second World War , Poland 's lost a higher percentage of people than any other nation in the world , and the fertility rate dropped to just over 3 children per woman during this time . Poland did experience a brief 'baby boom ' during the two decades after the war , before the rate fell to it 's lowest point ever in 2005 , where it was below 1.3 children per woman , and this number is expected to rise slightly by 2020 , to 1.4 .
