The infant mortality rate in China , for children under the age of one year old , was approximately 195 deaths per thousand births in 1950 . This means that for all babies born in 1950 , almost one in five did not survive past their first birthday . This rate fell to just under 130 deaths in 1955 , before increasing slightly in the next decade , as Chairman Mao Zedong 's 'Great Leap Forward ' failed to industrialize the country and created a famine that killed millions of people . Over the past half century , China 's infant mortality rate has decreased gradually to just ten deaths per thousand births today .
