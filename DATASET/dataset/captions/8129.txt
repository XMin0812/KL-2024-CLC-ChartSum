Since 1967 there have been numerous devastating oil spills around the world . The largest was in 1991 , during the Persian Gulf War , in which an estimated 380 to 520 million gallons of oil was deliberately spilled by Iraqi forces into the Persian Gulf . This was done in a bid to stop U.S. and coalition forces landing , with oil slicks in some areas as thick as five inches .
