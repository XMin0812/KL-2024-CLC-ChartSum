The infant mortality rate in Canada , for children under the age of one year old , was 187 deaths per thousand births in 1900 . This means that for all babies born in 1865 , almost one fifth did not survive past their first birthday . Over the course of the next 120 years , this number has dropped significantly . The rate dropped to its lowest point ever in the 2000s , at five deaths per thousand births .
