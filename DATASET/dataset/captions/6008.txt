The fertility rate of a country is the average number of children that women from that country will have throughout their reproductive years . From 1840 until 1910 , Russia 's fertility rate was relatively consistent , remaining between 6.7 and 7.4 children per woman during this time . Between 1910 and 1920 , the fertility rate drops sharply as a result of the First World War and Russian Revolution ( for individual years of WWI , the fertility rate dropped as low as 3.4 ) . From 1920 to 1930 the fertility rate returns above 6 again , however a gradual decline then begins , and by the end of the Second World War , the Russian segment of the Soviet Union 's fertility rate was below 2 . The population experienced a relatively small 'baby boom ' in the two decades following the war , but then the fertility rate dropped again , most sharply between 1990 and 1995 at the end of the Soviet Union 's reign . Russia 's fertility rate reached its lowest point in 2000 when it fell to just 1.25 children per woman , but in the past two decades it has risen again , and is expected to reach 1.8 in 2020 .
