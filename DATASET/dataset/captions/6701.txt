Throughout U.S. history , there have been countless plots and attempts to assassinate U.S. presidents . The first known case was a failed attempt on Andrew Jackson 's life in 1835 , where both the assassin 's guns misfired due to moisture in the air , and Jackson then beat the culprit into submission with his cane . More recent attempts include separate , high-profile cases in October 2018 , where sixteen bombs were sent via mail to prominent Democrats ( including presidents Obama and Clinton ) , Trump critics and news outlets ; while another culprit sent letters laced with ricin to President Trump and senior U.S. military figures . In the two centuries since the first attempt , the majority of plots have been uncovered or prevented , however several have come close to achieving their aims , and four have resulted in the successful assassination of a sitting president .
