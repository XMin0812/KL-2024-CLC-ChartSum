In November 2020 , the U.S. Small Business Optimism Index amounted to 101.4 . This is a decrease from a value of 104 in October 2020 , which can be attributed to the global novel coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) pandemic . The index consists of 10 indicators derived from questions addressing small business owners : Plans to create employment ; plans to make capital outlays ; plans to increase inventories ; expect economy to improve ; expect real sales higher ; current inventory ; current job openings ; expected credit conditions ; now a good time to expand ; earnings trends .
