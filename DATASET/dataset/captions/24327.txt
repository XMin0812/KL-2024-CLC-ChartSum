The child mortality rate in Belgium , for children under the age of five , was 322 deaths per thousand births in 1800 . This means that roughly one in every three children born in 1800 did not make it to their fifth birthday . Over the course of the next 220 years , this number has dropped drastically , particularly in the first half of the twentieth century , and the rate has dropped to its lowest point ever in 2020 where it is just three deaths per thousand births . The only point where the child mortality rate increased in Belgium since the twentieth century was immediately after the Second World War .
