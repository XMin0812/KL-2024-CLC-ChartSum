Boeing 's research and development costs were around 3.2 billion U.S. dollars in 2019 , down from almost 3.3 billion in 2018 . The decrease in expenses came as a result of lower spending related to the 737 and 777 model families . The level of research and development expenditure was highest in 2016 and ahead of the 787 Dreamliner jet family launch . The Dreamliner is one of the company 's most important model families , trailing only the 737 series .
