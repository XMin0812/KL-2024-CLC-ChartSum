The total number of banks and credit institutions in Italy steadily decreased from 2011 to 2019 , sinking from 740 to 485 units . Such a decrease in the number of banks in the country might be due to the financial crisis of the years 2007 and 2008 , which hit Italy quite harshly also in the following years . During the same period , the number of bank branches also decreased steadily , and , as a consequence , the population size per bank branch increased from 1,734 in 2008 to 2,067 in 2016 .
