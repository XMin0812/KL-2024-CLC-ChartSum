The number of members of the National Association of Realtors ( NAR ) has steadily increased since 2012 , reaching a membership of 1.4 million in 2019 , an all-time high . This trend also reflects the recovery of the property market after the financial crisis of 2007 - 2009 , as the volume of home sales began to climb from 2011 . The NAR is a North American trade association for real estate workers formed in 1908 and currently based in Chicago , Illinois .
