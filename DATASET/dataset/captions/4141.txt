The child mortality rate in the United States , for children under the age of five , was 462.9 deaths per thousand births in 1800 . This means that for every thousand babies born in 1800 , over 46 percent did not make it to their fifth birthday . Over the course of the next 220 years , this number has dropped drastically , and the rate has dropped to its lowest point ever in 2020 where it is just seven deaths per thousand births . Although the child mortality rate has decreased greatly over this 220 year period , there were two occasions where it increased ; in the 1870s , as a result of the fourth cholera pandemic , smallpox outbreaks , and yellow fever , and in the late 1910s , due to the Spanish Flu pandemic .
