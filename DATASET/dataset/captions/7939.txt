In 2019 , Boeing received gross orders for 69 units of its 737 narrow-body jet airliner series , but net orders after cancellations and changes ( under the ASC 606 revenue recognition standard ) came to a devastating negative 183 units . The slump in net orders came as a result of the jet maker 's 737 MAX crisis . Boeing delivered some 18 units of its 737 aircraft to Delta Air Lines in 2019 . Upon delivery of the last 737 - 900 ( ER ) , Delta announced in a statement that the company will cut ties with Boeing and switch to Airbus airplanes .
