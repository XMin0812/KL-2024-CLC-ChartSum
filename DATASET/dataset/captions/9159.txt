According to a survey about the impact of the coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) on Indians in March 2020 , a majority of respondents bought hand sanitizers higher than the government mandated price of 100 Indian rupees for 200 milliliters . However , about 26 percent managed to buy them online at the mandated price in the week preceding the survey . India implemented a lockdown for 21 days , announced on March 24 , 2020 . This was after the `` Janata Curfew '' on March 22 , 2020 - a so-called practice lockdown . Panic-buying commenced among consumers days before the lockdown was announced , much like in other countries . This lockdown was the largest in the world , restricting 1.3 billion people .
