In December 2019 , singer-songwriter Angèle had the most followers of all Belgian influencers on Instagram . This according to data provided by InfluencerDB . The musician had several hit songs in 2018 , including number one hit Tout Oublier in Belgium and France with her brother Romeo Elvis ( fourth in this ranking ) . Most influencers in this ranking are either active in music ( such as rapper Roméo Elvis and DJ Amelie Lens ) or in fashion , like Matthias Geerts and Chloé Kitembo . Gaëlle Garcia Diaz ( sixth in the ranking ) and fellow-vlogger and actor Jimmy Labeeu ( in second ) were married to each other for several years . Instagram users in Belgium were typically women , aged 18 to 24 years old , which could be a potential explanation for these interests .
