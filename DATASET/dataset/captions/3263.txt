Market capitalization , also known as stock market value , is the total value of issued shares of a publicly traded company . It is equal to the share price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding . It applies only to publicly traded companies or companies that have made their stock market debut , also known as the initial public offering , or an IPO . Due to the practice of buying and selling stock in public markets , market capitalization can be used as a proxy for the wider public 's opinion of a company 's net worth .
