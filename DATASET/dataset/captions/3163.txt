The largest geothermal plant in the world is called the Geysers Geothermal Complex , located in the United States , with a capacity of 1,517 megawatts . It is made up of 22 power plants and spread over several kilometers , located north of San Francisco . It sits on top of a deep magma chamber that spans over 30 square miles . The United States also has one of the highest installed capacities of geothermal power in the world . The thermal efficiency of geothermal plants is low due to the relatively low temperatures of geothermal fluids ; however , its capacity factor tends to be high as it relies on a stable source of energy , unlike wind or solar .
