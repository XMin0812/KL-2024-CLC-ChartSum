In 2019 , live event specialist Live Nation generated a total of 11.55 billion US dollars in revenue , up from 10.79 billion a year earlier . Of this revenue generated in 2019 , over 1.54 billion U.S. dollars came from ticketing revenue and 9.43 billion U.S. dollars was generated through concerts . The company promoted a total of 40,256 concerts and festivals in 2019 , the highest figure to date . Unfortunately , the coronavirus quickly impacted Live Nation amidst thousands of event closures or postponements , and the company 's share price between February and March 2020 dropped significantly . How deeply affected the company will be by the end of the financial year remains to be seen , but 2020 will arguably be a difficult year for events operators .
