The share of Swedish social media users increased consistently over the period from 2010 to 2020 . Just over half of Swedes used social networking platforms in 2010 , whereas the corresponding figures for as of the third quarter of 2020 were 89 percent . The social media penetration among children in the country was also noticeable . As of 2018 , over half of the interviewed ten-year-olds reported to be using social media . The share of six-year-olds amounted to six percent and was , therefore , the age group with smallest penetration rate that year .
