In the history of the Earth , there have been at least five major periods of consistent glaciation and glacial expansion , known colloquially as 'ice ages ' _ . These ice ages are triggered by a variety of reasons , most commonly due to atmospheric changes which affect how heat is retained on the earths surface . The shared characteristic of these glacial epochs is the presence of ice sheets , which form when low temperatures prevent snow from melting . This snow then compacts and transforms into ice sheets over thousands of years , as new snow accumulates on top and is compressed further . During this process the sea levels also drop considerably , as glaciers move they carve out new terrains , and the rivers that form when they melt cause further changes to the Earth 's surface . Looking at the ocean floor today , we can see many areas that were once flourishing eco systems with a diversity of flora and fauna , but have been submerged under water for millennia .
