Between 1955 and 2020 , Afghanistan 's infant mortality rate ( for children under the age of one year old ) dropped consistently and almost linearly . In 1955 the infant mortality rate totaled 276 deaths per thousand live births , which meant that over one quarter of all babies born did not make it to their first birthday . Today , Afghanistan 's infant mortality rate is 56 deaths per thousand births , which is roughly one fifth the total seventy years ago . Despite this significant progress , Afghanistan still has one of the highest infant mortality rates in the world , and the highest of any non-African nation .
