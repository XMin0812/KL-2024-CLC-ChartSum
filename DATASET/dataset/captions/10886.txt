Unfortunately for Shakespeare 's eponymous characters , they are almost three times more likely to die by the end of their stories , with murder as the most common ending . All of Shakespeare 's tragedies and historical plays are named after one of their protagonists , all of whom are based on real historical figures or already-existing legends . Nine of the title characters meet this end ; Titus Andronicus , Julius Caesar , Coriolanus , Henry VI and Richard II are all stabbed to death , Richard III is killed and Macbeth is beheaded in battle , Hamlet is both poisoned and stabbed in a duel , and King John is poisoned .
