Since 1789 , 44 different men have served as the President of the United States ( Grover Cleveland    is counted twice , therefore Donald Trump is officially the 45th president ) . In that time , the majority of presidents served their full four or eight year terms , while four died while in office , and four more were assassinated . The shortest term served by a US president was William Henry Harrison , who died just 31 days into his tenure . The longest term ever served was by Franklin D. Roosevelt , who is the only president to have been elected more than two times ; although he died just forty days into his fourth presidential term . The only president to have ever resigned while in office was Richard Nixon , who stepped down amid the Watergate scandal in 1972 . For most of U.S. history , presidents have been inaugurated in March following the election ; however , since 1953 , US presidents have been sworn in on January 20th , providing there were no extenuating circumstances .
