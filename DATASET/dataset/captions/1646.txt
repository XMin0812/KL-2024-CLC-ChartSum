A study examining perspectives on the news media from 38 countries revealed that levels of trust differed notably around the world , although on the most part trust in European media was highest . Western Europeans in particular had greater trust in the news media than citizens from other parts of the world , with the exception of France where only 24 percent of respondents said that they trusted news most of the time . France was placed among the lowest in the world when it came to how much consumers trusted the news media , alongside South Korea , Hungary and Greece . Media sources in these countries can be considered to be insufficiently independent from the establishment , whereas in France the low trust could be attributed to recent civil dispute . `` The Yellow Vest '' movement sparked major unrest , with some journalists attacked for their position . One factor which can greatly affect trust in news is the outlet used . Globally , social media is seen as a less reliable source of news , and in the EU radio and television are viewed as more dependable . In the current climate of fake news and polarizing political events , young people around the world are having a tough time relying on the mass media , although this attitude is also seen among older generations .
