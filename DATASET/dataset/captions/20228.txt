From 2008 to 2018 , drug trafficking cases decreased in Belgium . Although the overall number of drug-related crimes was on the rise in Belgium , drug trafficking went down from 7.5 thousand cases to 2.6 thousand cases over this period . As of the first half of 2019 , over a thousand drug trafficking cases were registered by the Belgian police . However , these figures solely represent reported cases , meaning some drug traffic could be left unregistered .
