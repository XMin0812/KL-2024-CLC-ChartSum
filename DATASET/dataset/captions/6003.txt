By 1800 , London had grown to be the largest city in Western Europe with just under one million inhabitants . Paris was now the second largest city , with over half a million people , and Naples was the third largest city with 450 thousand people . The only other cities with over two hundred thousand inhabitants at this time were Vienna , Amsterdam and Dublin . Another noticeable development is the inclusion of many more northern cities from a wider variety of countries . The dominance of cities from France and Mediterranean countries was no longer the case , and the dispersal of European populations in 1800 was much closer to how it is today , more than two centuries later .
