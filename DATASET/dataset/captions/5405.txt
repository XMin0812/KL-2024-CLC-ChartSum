This 2015 statistic shows how worried British respondents are about a terrorist attack happening in Britain . The largest share of respondents reported feeling quite worried , with over 40 percent , while 4 percent reported feeling not worried at all .

Yet despite this fact the perceived threat of a terrorist attack remains high .
