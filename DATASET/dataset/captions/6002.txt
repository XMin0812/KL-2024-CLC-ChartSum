Prior to 1829 , the area of modern day Greece was largely under the control of the Ottoman Empire . In 1821 , the Greeks declared their independence from the Ottomans , and achieved it within 8 years through the Greek War of Independence . The Independent Kingdom of Greece was established in 1829 and made up the southern half of present-day , mainland Greece , along with some Mediterranean islands . Over the next century , Greece 's borders would expand and readjust drastically , through a number of conflicts and diplomatic agreements ; therefore the population of Greece within those political borders   was much lower than the population in what would be today 's borders . As there were large communities of ethnic Greeks living in neighboring countries during this time , particularly in Turkey , and the data presented here does not show the full extent of the First World War , Spanish Flu Pandemic and Greko-Turkish War on these Greek populations . While it is difficult to separate the fatalities from each of these events , it is estimated that between 500,000 and 900,000 ethnic Greeks died at the hands of the Ottomans between the years 1914 and 1923 , and approximately 150,000 died due to the 1918 flu pandemic . These years also saw the exchange of up to one million Orthodox Christians from Turkey to Greece , and several hundred thousand Muslims from Greece to Turkey ; this exchange is one reason why Greece 's total population did not change drastically , despite the genocide , displacement and demographic upheaval of the 1910s and 1920s .
