In Australia , the crude birth rate in 1800 was 45 births per thousand people , meaning that 4.5 percent of the population had been born in that year . In the first half of the nineteenth century , Australia 's crude birth rate decreased gradually , reaching just under 36 in 1850 , however it then increased again over the next fifteen years , as the gold rushes brought many immigrants to the continent . After this , the crude birth rate dropped gradually until the Second World War , after the war Australia experienced another baby boom , reaching it 's peak of 23 children per thousand in 1955 . In the late 1970s the rate dropped rather sharply , falling from around twenty in 1970 to 15.8 in 1980 , and since then the birth rate has decreased at a slower rate , and has fallen below thirteen births per thousand people in 2020 .
