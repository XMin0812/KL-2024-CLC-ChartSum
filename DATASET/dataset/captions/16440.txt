This statistic shows the results of a survey among adults in the Ukraine on whether Russian-speaking citizens of the Ukraine face discrimination or threats because of their language . The survey was conducted in March 2014 in light of the civil unrest and demonstrations in Ukraine over joining the European Union or forming a union with Russia , as protesters did not want Ukraine to form closer bonds with Russia . During this survey , 71 percent of respondents in Ukraine said they do not feel that Russian-speaking citizens are under pressure or threat because of their language .
