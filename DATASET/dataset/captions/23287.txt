In April 2019 , the Sri Lankan government cut off social media access in the wake of a fatal terrorist attack . According to an Ipsos survey conducted a month later , a total of 62 of the respondents stated that temporarily cutting off social media platforms during times of crisis is unacceptable given that many people relied on them for news and information . Peru and Turkey were ranked first in their disagreement with this action , with 74 percent of respondents from both countries citing a temporary social media band as unacceptable .
