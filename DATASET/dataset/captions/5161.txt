In the century between Napoleon 's defeat and the outbreak of the First World War ( known as the `` Pax Britannica '' ) , the British Empire grew to become the largest and most powerful empire in the world . At its peak in the 1910s and 1920s , it encompassed almost one quarter of both the world 's population and its land surface , and was known as `` the empire on which the sun never sets '' . The empire 's influence could be felt across the globe , as Britain could use it 's position to affect trade and economies in all areas of the world , including many regions that were not part of the formal empire ( for example , Britain was able to affect trading policy in China for over a century , due to it 's control of Hong Kong and the neighboring colonies of India and Burma ) . Some historians argue that because of it 's economic , military , political and cultural influence , nineteenth century Britain was the closest thing to a hegemonic superpower that the world ever had , and possibly ever will have .
