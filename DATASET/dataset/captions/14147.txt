Marijuana is by far the most used illicit drug in the United States , with around 48.2 million people using this drug in 2019 . The second most used drug at that time was cocaine , followed by ecstasy and LSD . The United States has had a complicated history with drugs , from fighting a `` War on Drugs '' starting in the 1970s , to seeing the legalisation of marijuana in many states , and experiencing an ongoing nationwide opioid overdose epidemic .
