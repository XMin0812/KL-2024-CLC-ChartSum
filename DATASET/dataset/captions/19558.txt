In the early twentieth century , modern-day Czechia and Slovakia were united , as a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until after World War I . It then became an independent state in 1918 , although the borders did change during this time and after the Second World War , until it peacefully dissolved into the both the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993 . The population of Czechoslovakia did not grow significantly between 1910 and 1921 , and in regards to gender the male population actually decreased by around 50 thousand . The population drastically decreases from 1930 to 1946/7 , from 14.7 to 12.2 million people . These changes are mostly as a result of both World Wars , and the rearranging of Czechoslovakia 's borders , particularly in the east . After 1946/7 the population grows quite gradually , and is almost reaches it 's pre-WWII height again in 1970 , with 14.35 million people .
