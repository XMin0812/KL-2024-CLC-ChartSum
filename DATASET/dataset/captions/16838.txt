This graph shows the distribution of nationalities among documented immigrants who arrived in the United States between 1820 and 1870 . As we can see , over seven million people arrived in the US in this 50 year period , with the majority coming from Ireland , Germany and Britain . The largest groups , by far , were Irish and German , who together made up roughly two thirds of all immigrants to the US during this time . The reasons for this were because of the Irish Potato famine from 1845 to 1849 , which resulted in the death or emigration of twenty to twenty five percent of the total Irish population , and a number of internal factors in Germany such as economic migration for farmers affected by industrialization , political/religious asylum , and in order to avoid conscription . One noteworthy exclusion from the information is of those transported to US as slaves , whose information was not recorded in this statistic ( although the slave trade was abolished in 1808 , the practice continued in the decades that followed ) .
