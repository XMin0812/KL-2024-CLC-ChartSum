The child mortality rate in China , for children under the age of five , was 417 deaths per thousand births in 1850 . This means that for all children born in 1850 , almost 42 percent did not make it to their fifth birthday . Over the course of the next 170 years , this number has dropped drastically , and the rate has dropped to its lowest point ever in 2020 where it is just twelve deaths per thousand births . The sharpest decrease came between 1950 and 1955 , as the Chinese Civil War ended , and the country began to recover from the Second World War . The decline then stopped between 1955 and 1965 , due to famines caused by Chairman Mao Zedong 's attempted Great Leap Forward , which was a failed attempt to industrialize China in the late twentieth century .
