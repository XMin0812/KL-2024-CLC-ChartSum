This timeline shows the average print circulation of the Spanish daily El Pais from 1999 to 2019 , and in the period between July 2018 and June 2019 , circulation amounted to 164.8 thousand . Whilst this figure marks an increase from the average daily circulation recorded in the corresponding fiscal period of the previous year , it still falls far short of the number reported a decade ago , reflecting the ongoing downward struggle for many newspapers and magazines in an increasingly digital world .
