This statistic displays the annual exchange rate ( average or standardized measure ) of the euro to the Canadian dollar ( EUR CAD ) , according to the data provided by the European Central Bank , starting from the introduction of the euro in 1999 up until the 2019 . This is the average , or standardized , measure ; it denotes a calculation of average based on many observations throughout the period in question . It is different to the concrete ( point in time ) measure . The second one is used to show the exchange rate as it looked like in a specific point in time , for example at end of the month or end of the year , at closing . Between years 2009 and 2012 , the exchange rate noted a sharp decline in value , with the annual average exchange rate of the euro to the Canadian dollar falling 1.59 to 1.29 by 2012 . This meant that one euro could buy 1.29 Canadian dollars . This sharp decline was most likely associated with the volatile changes brought to the financial markets by the global recession . Since 2012 , the annual average euro to Canadian dollar exchange rate has recovered to the level of 1.49 as of 2019 ; however it remains to be lower , compared to 1999 , the first year of the observation .
