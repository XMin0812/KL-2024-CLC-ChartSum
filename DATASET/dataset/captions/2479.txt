This statistic shows the countries with the lowest risk of natural disasters according to the Global Risk Index in 2020 . At this time , Qatar , with an index value of 0.31 , was the safest country in the world . In the framework of the WorldRiskIndex , disaster risk is analyzed as a complex interplay of natural hazards and social , political and environmental factors . Unlike current approaches that focus strongly on the analysis of the various natural hazards , the WorldRiskIndex , in addition to exposure analysis , focuses on the vulnerability of the population , i.e . its susceptibility , its capacities to cope with and to adapt to future natural events as well as the consequences of climate change . Disaster risk is seen as a function of exposure and vulnerability . The national states are the frame of reference for the analysis . The index consists of indicators in four components : exposure to natural hazards such as earthquakes , storms , floods , droughts and sea level rise ; susceptibility as a function of public infrastructure , nutrition and the general economic framework ; coping capacities as a function of governance , medical services and economic security ; and adaptive capacities to future natural events and climate change .
