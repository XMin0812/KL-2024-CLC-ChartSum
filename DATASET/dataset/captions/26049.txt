Between 1820 and 1957 , at least 400,000 people migrated from Poland to the United States . Due to Poland 's complicated border-history , many Polish migrants were recorded as having other nationalities , particularly Austrian , German and Russian ( all migrants who claimed to be Polish between 1899 and 1919 were recorded as being one of these other nationalities ) , therefore the exact number of Polish migrants to the United States during this time is unknown . From 1920 onwards , Poland 's sovereignty and independence was acknowledged by the United States government ( US President Wilson was instrumental in helping to establish the independent Republic of Poland ) , and the figures become more reliable . The years with the highest number of documented Polish migrants to the US was after the First World War in the early 1920s , with almost 100,000 Poles migrating in 1921 alone , although the number fell below 10,000 again by 1925 .
