Life expectancy in the United Kingdom was below 39 years in the year 1765 , and over the course of the next two and a half centuries , it is expected to have increased by more than double , to 81.1 by the year 2020 . Although life expectancy has generally increased throughout the UK 's history , there were several times where the rate deviated from its previous trajectory . These changes were the result of smallpox epidemics in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries , new sanitary and medical advancements throughout time ( such as compulsory vaccination ) , and the First world War and Spanish Flu epidemic in the 1910s .
