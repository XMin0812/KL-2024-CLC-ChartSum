This statistic shows the total number of light commercial vehicles on the road in the United Kingdom ( UK ) between 2007 and 2015 . The number of LCVs on the road has consistently been growing . However , even though this number is increasing , it should also be taken into account that the average age of cars on the road is also increasing , meaning that fewer LCV owners are replacing their old vehicles .
