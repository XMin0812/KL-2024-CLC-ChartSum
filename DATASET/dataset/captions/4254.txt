This statistic shows the monthly number of new Vauxhall cars registered in the United Kingdom ( UK ) between July 2016 and December 2019 . In December 2019 , there were roughly 6,200 new Vauxhall cars registered in the UK . This value is around half the number sold in December 2018 . Despite the fall in sales volume and a loss of market share in 2019 , Vauxhall is one of the leading car companies in the UK . The peaks seen in March and September are due to the issuing of new registration plates by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency .
