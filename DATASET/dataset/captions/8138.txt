This graph shows the estimated population in the city of Paris from 1989 to 2019 . It appears that the number of inhabitants in the French capital decreased since 2012 and from 2.24 million Parisians that year down to 2.14 million in 2019 . The high price of rents in the French capital might explain why a lot of people leave Paris to live in cheaper cities in France or in the Paris agglomeration .
