Geothermal heat pumps , also known as ground source heat pumps , is a central system which transfers heat from or to the ground and can be used for heating and/or cooling . Since the RHI domestic program was formally launched in April 2014 , oil was the most common fuel to be replaced by geothermal heat pumps , accounting with 27 percent of the fuel types displaced by this renewable technology . Great Britain has begun a transformation to a low carbon heat system , launching the non-domestic Renewable Heat Incentive ( RHI ) in 2011 and further implementing RHI in the domestic sector in 2014 . A large proportion of RHI applications and accreditations are located in Scotland . Under the RHI , fossil fuels have been replaced by air source heat pumps , ground source heat pumps , biomass and solar thermal systems .
