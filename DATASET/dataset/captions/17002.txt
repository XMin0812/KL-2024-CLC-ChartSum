This graph shows the total number of soldiers who were enlisted in the Union and Confederate armies during the American Civil War , between 1861 and 1865 . The total population of the Union states was 18.9 million in 1860 , and the Confederate states in the south had a population of 8.6 million . The Border States , who primarily supported the Union but sent troops to both sides , had a population of 3.5 million . From the graph we can see that over the course of the war a total of 2.1 million men enlisted for the Union Army , and 1.1 million enlisted for the Confederate Army . The Union Army had roughly double the number of soldiers of the Confederacy , and although the Confederacy won more major battles than the Union in the early stages of the war , the strength of numbers in the Union forces was a decisive factor in their overall victory as the war progressed .
