The fertility rate of a country is the average number of children that women from that country would have throughout their reproductive years . In France in 1800 , the average woman of childbearing age would have 4.4 children over the course of their lifetime . The beginning of the nineteenth century was a tumultuous time in France 's history , involving France 's revolutionary period , as well as the Napoleonic Empire . In the first decade of the 1800s , the fertility rate dropped by 0.4 , before dropping more slowly , by another 0.5 between 1810 and 1850 . The fertility growth rate fluctuated slightly in the late 1800s , before dropping drastically in the early twentieth century , falling from an average of 3 children per woman to less than 1.7 in 1920 . France 's fertility rate reached this point as a result of the First World War , and the influenza epidemic ( known as the Spanish Flu ) that followed . The interwar period saw a slight increase in fertility rate , before it fell again in the Second World War . Similarly to other major European countries after the war , France experienced a baby boom in the two decades following the war , before dropping again into the 1980s . The fertility rate reached it 's lowest point in the post-war period , falling to 1.7 in 1995 , before increasing in more recent years .
