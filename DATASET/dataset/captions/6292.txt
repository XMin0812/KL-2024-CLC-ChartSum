Respiratory therapy drugs witnessed the highest sales across India in March 2020 compared to February that same year , recording a growth of nearly 23 percent . This was due to the coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) epidemic and despite a nation-wide lockdown that disrupted distribution of drugs and prescription medicines . On the other hand , segments such as dermatology , gastrointestinal , pain and analgesics , and vaccines showed a decline in sales during the same time period . The country went into lockdown earlier that week , the largest in the world , restricting 1.3 billion people .
