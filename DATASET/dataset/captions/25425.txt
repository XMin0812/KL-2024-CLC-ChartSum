The World Health Organization classifies four main groups of people according to their Body Mass Index ( BMI ) : underweight , normal weight , pre-obese , and obese . In 2018 , roughly half of the Belgian population fell in the normal weight group . However , a third of the population fell in the overweight group . The BMI ranges are based on the effect excessive body fat has on disease and death and are reasonably well related to adiposity . Over the benchmark of 29.9 , the BMI can be further divided into Obesity classes : one ( 30 - 34.9 ) , two ( 35 - 39.9 ) , and three ( 40+ ) . In Belgium , roughly 16 percent of people fell into one of these categories in 2018 .
