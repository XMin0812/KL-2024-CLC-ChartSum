In 2018 , Samsung was the brand with the highest Buzz score in the Netherlands , followed by two Dutch brands : food retailer Albert Heijn and Philips . A brand 's Buzz score indicates how positive a brand is perceived in a certain country . The survey tracks how many people have heard anything about a certain brand in the last two weeks , through advertising , news or word of mouth . Positive and negative answers are subtracted , and the higher the score , the better the brand 's evaluation in a country . Not just topping the ranking in the Netherlands , Samsung also did well in other countries . In the United States Samsung reached the 4th position in the ranking , and in Sweden and Denmark Samsung came in 6th and 10th position respectively .
