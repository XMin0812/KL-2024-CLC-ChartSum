This statistic shows the population of the Netherlands in 2019 , by gender . On January 1 , 2019 , approximately 8.6 million people living in the Netherlands were male and roughly 8.7 million were female , making the female population in the Netherlands the majority . As this statistic on the life expectancy at birth in the Netherlands shows , women in the Netherlands live some three years longer than men . For this reason it is not surprising that the number of women living in the Netherlands is larger than the number of men . According to a recent forecast , the life expectancy is likely to increase even further in the future , narrowing the gap between the genders to approximately 2.8 years in 2060 , but not completely eliminating it .
