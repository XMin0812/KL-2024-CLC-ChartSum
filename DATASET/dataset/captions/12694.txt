In 1894 , Baron Pierre de Coubertin Participation , who held strong believes about the role of women in sport , established the modern Olympic Games . It is not surprising that women were excluded from the first modern Olympic Games , held in Athens in 1896 . Despite strong objection from de Coubertin , the 1900 Summer Olympics , held in Paris , became the first event to which female athletes were permitted to participate . Participation for women was still heavily restricted to only five sports that were considered to be compatible with their femininity and fragility , tennis , sailing , croquet , equestrian and golf . Since this time the participation of women within the Olympic Games has increased significantly , however it was not until the 2012 Olympic Games in London that there was female representation within all sports in the Olympic program .
