Depicted are only individuals or corporations who gave 1 million U.S. dollars or more . Thus , not all super PACs playing a role in the election are depicted here . Beside the name of the donor , the receiving super PAC is given in brackets . For additional information regarding the donor , hover the cursor over the respective bar in the graph . Sheldon and Miriam Adelson are now the biggest donors , having donated 20 million U.S. dollars to the super PAC endorsing Newt Gingrich , Winning Our Future .
