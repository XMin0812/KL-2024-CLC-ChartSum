The fertility rate of a country is the average number of children that women from that country will have throughout their reproductive years . In 1860 , Canadian women of childbearing age would go on to have 5.7 children on average , however this number dropped significantly by 1925 , where it was just 3.3 . It then plateaued in the late 1920s , before dropping again , to 2.7 in 1940 . Similarly to the United States , Canada experienced a large baby boom after the Second World War , rising to 3.9 in 1960 , before declining again into the 1980s , and then plateauing between 1.5 and 1.7 until today . Canada 's fertility rate is expected to be 1.5 children per woman in 2020 .
