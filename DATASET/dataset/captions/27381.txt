This statistic shows the total damage due to credit card fraud in the Netherlands from 2013 to 2018 ( in million euros ) . In 2018 , credit card fraud in the Netherlands led to a total damage of approximately 3.4 million euros . Like in other European countries , credit and debit cards are a popular form of digital payment methods for either physical purchases in brick-and-mortar-stores or for online purchases . Consumers from the Benelux countries are familiar with credit cards and possess them . Ever since the launch of digital payments , the payments industry tried to create a secure environment for financial transactions . Debit and credit card fraud comes in different kinds , of which phishing , skimming and identity theft are the most common ones . It is predicted that technology as EMV ( Europay MasterCard Visa , a credit card technology that uses computer chips to authenticate chip-card transactions ) should make some payments safer , but fraud could still remain a problem for the near future . During a survey in 2015 , approximately one third of Dutch respondents indicated they were fairly concerned about surveillance via payment cards .
