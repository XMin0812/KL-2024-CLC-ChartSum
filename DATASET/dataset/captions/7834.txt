Dutch households had nearly 735 billion euros of outstanding mortgage loans at the end of 2019 , a significant value when compared to earlier years . Despite its relatively small population size , the Netherlands had a much higher mortgage debt than most other European countries and was not far from those found in the United Kingdom , France or Germany . This has a political background as the Dutch government for many years wanted to help people to buy a house . The tax system allowed homeowners to deduct interests paid on mortgage from pre-tax income for a maximum period of thirty years . This was known as hypotheekrenteaftrek , and consequently lead to the Netherlands becoming the European country with the highest share of the population who is an owner-occupier with a mortgage . Since 2014 , the Dutch government is slowly scaling this tax facility down , with an acceleration planned from 2020 onwards .
