As per the latest company data , in 2019 , American tech company IBM employed around 352 thousand people worldwide , a change from the previous general trend of declining number of employees over the six years period between 2012 and 2018 . IBM has been facing declining revenues and consequently is trying to restructure its business model , which could partly explain the decreasing number of current employees . Since early 2019 , IBM is facing a class action lawsuit that claims the company violated federal law against age discrimination , though IBM maintains it makes its employment decisions based on skills .
