The expectation for women in France was 85.6 years in 2019 . Variations are relatively small by region , except for the island of Mayotte . Indeed , the gap is three years ( except Mayotte ) between Corsican women and those in Haut-de-France . It is indeed on the island of beauty where life expectancy is the longest with an average of 86.4 years . Mayotte is therefore an exception in the French landscape with a life expectancy of 76 years at birth . In France , it is always women who live the longest . On average , they would have five more years of life expectancy than their male counterparts .
