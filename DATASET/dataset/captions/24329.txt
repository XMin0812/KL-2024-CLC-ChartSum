The total fertility rate of Brazil at the end of the nineteenth century was approximately 6.3 births per woman ; this means that the average woman of reproductive age would have roughly 6 children in their lifetime . Brazil 's fertility rate then decreased and plateaued at just under six children per women in the first half of the twentieth century , before increasing slightly in the 1940s ; this increase coincides with the worldwide baby boom that was experienced in the aftermath of the Second World War , during which time Brazil 's economy and political landscape stabilized . From the late 1960s onwards , Brazil 's fertility rate went into decline , and dropped by approximately three children per woman in the next three decades . This decline is similar to that of many other developing nations during this time , where access to contraception , improved education and declining infant and child mortality rates contributed to lower fertility rate across the globe . In the past fifteen years , Brazil 's fertility rate has continued to decrease ( albeit , at a much slower rate than in previous decades ) and in 2020 , it is expected to be at just 1.7 children per woman .
