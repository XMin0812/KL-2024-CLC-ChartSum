In the second quarter of 2020 , the volume of collected household waste electrical and electronic equipment ( WEEE ) plummeted to just over 64 thousand metric tons - around half the typical quarterly collection volume . This significant reduction was caused by the nationwide lockdowns caused by the outbreak of COVID-19 . By the following quarter , collections had increased massively to almost 200 thousand metric tons . The UK is one of the biggest producers of WEEE in the world .
