Life expectancy ( from birth ) in Mexico was below thirty until the 1920s , and over the course of the next hundred years , it is expected to have increased to roughly 75 in the year 2020 . Although life expectancy has generally increased throughout Mexico 's history , there were several times where the rate deviated from its previous trajectory . The main change coincided with the Mexican Revolution in the 1910s , and again in the early 2000s . Life expectancy has plateaued around 75 in the last fifteen years , and is now decreasing , because of unhealthy lifestyles , violent crime and an increase in the number of people with chronic illnesses ( such as diabetes ) .
