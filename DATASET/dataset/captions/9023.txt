In 2018 , Dutch pension funds had roughly 1,455 billion euros worth of assets under management ( AUM ) . Only funds from the United Kingdom had more within the EU-28 , with over 2,400 billion euros . It is compulsory in the Netherlands to participate in a pension fund when you are employed . Part of one 's salary is transferred to a pension fund each month . These payments are used to invest further in order to provide a future supplement to the state pension ( called AOW ) , a base income for any person who lives or works in the Netherlands after the employee retires . Because of this system , pension funds make up the majority of the financial assets of households in the country .
