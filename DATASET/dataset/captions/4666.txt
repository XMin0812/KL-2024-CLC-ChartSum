While building societies specialize in savings and mortgage lending , they also offer many traditional banking products like current accounts with a debit card , check book , overdraft , and online banking . What differentiates them from banks is that they are not traded on the stock market and do not have shareholders . Instead , the decision-makers of building societies are the investing members , who receive information about general meetings and can vote in elections for the board of directors .
