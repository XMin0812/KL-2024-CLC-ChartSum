The Black Death was the largest and deadliest pandemic of Yersinia pestis recorded in human history , and likely the most infamous individual pandemic ever documented . The plague originated in the Eurasian Steppes , before moving with Mongol hordes to the Black Sea , where it was then brought by Italian merchants to the Mediterranean . From here , the Black Death then spread to almost all corners of Europe , the Middle East and North Africa . While it was never endemic to these regions , it was constantly re-introduced via trade routes from Asia ( such as the Silk Road ) , and plague was present in Western Europe until the seventeenth century , and the other regions until the nineteenth century .
