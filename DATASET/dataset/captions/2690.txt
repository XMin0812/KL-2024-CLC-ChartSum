The statistic shows the percentage of households that own a microwave oven in the United Kingdom ( UK ) from 1994 to 2018 . In 1994 , when this survey started , 67 percent of households owned a microwave . As of 2018 , that number had increased significantly to 93 percent of households . Microwave ovens heat the molecules directly using radiation and are therefore much faster at heating than a regular oven or pan . The first microwave oven was available for domestic use in the late 1960s , starting the home use of microwaves . They are often used to heat leftover foods , ready-made meals , or other ingredients used for cooking such as butter , but can also be used to heat up other items such as heating pads . Microwave oven penetration seems to have been stagnant since the mid 2000s in the United Kingdom . This may be attributable to the development of other kitchen appliances such as food steamers or immersion cookers .
