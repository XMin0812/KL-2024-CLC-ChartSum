The fertility rate is the average number of children per woman . In 2018 , this rate was 1.88 . This rate has been falling since the mid-1960s and reached its lowest level in 1993 and 1994 . Since then , the number of children per woman has been on the rise again , but is still insufficient to reach the generational replacement rate . Indeed , statisticians estimate that for a society not to decline , each woman should have an average of 2.05 children . Without the contribution of immigration , France would therefore see its population decline .
