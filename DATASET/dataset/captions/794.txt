Huawei have enjoyed a prolonged period of growth since at least 2012 , establishing themselves as a major challenger to Apple and Samsung as the premier smartphone producer . Huawei accounted for just 3.3 percent of the global smartphone market in the second quarter of 2012 , a figure that rose to 20 percent by the same quarter of 2020 . The growth comes in the face of political and trade restrictions , preventing Huawei from working with certain U.S. providers and restricting their involvement in the rollout of 5G infrastructure .
