After William Shakespeare 's passing in 1616 , some members of his acting troupe The Kings Men collected his plays and brought them to the publishers Edwin Blount and Issac Jaggard , who set to work making the book that would come to be known as the `` First Folio '' . The books were first published in 1623 as `` Mr. William Shakespare 's Comedies , Histories and Tragedies '' and contain 36 of the 37 plays that he wrote during his lifetime ( but omit all of his poems ) . It is called the `` First Folio ' _ ' because , although various plays of Shakespare 's had been published in smaller books called `` quartos '' earlier , this was the first book to collect his plays and publish them in the folio format . The term folio refers to the large size of paper on which the book was printed ; this type of paper was usually reserved for important documents , such as those of a theological , historical or regal nature , which alludes to the high level of prestige placed on his works . Researchers believe that around 750 copies were first published and of these , around 233 are known to still be around today .
