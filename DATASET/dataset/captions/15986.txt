Virgil van Dijk , who joined Liverpool in season 2017/18 , had a transfer of roughly 85 million euros , whereas Barcelona had to pay Ajax 75 million euros to buy Frenkie de Jong . The all-time highest fee ever paid for a football player is the transfer of Neymar from FC Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain ( PSG ) .
