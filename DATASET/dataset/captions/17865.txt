In 1800 , the population of modern day Algeria was estimated to be around 2.5 million people , and by the turn of the twentieth century it had almost doubled to five million . In the first three decades of the nineteenth century , Algeria was a semi-autonomous province of the Ottoman Empire , however an invasion by France in 1830 was the beginning of 130 years of French rule , and the development of Algeria 's modern borders by 1875 ( although northern Algeria was treated as an extension of the French metropole , with elected representatives in the Assembly ) . Although the rest of the century saw both medicinal and economic progress , French rule also dismantled traditional Algerian political and societal structures , as well as the oppression of Islam , particularly in rural areas .
