In 2019 , 10.6 percent of film directors in Hollywood were women , marking a huge jump from the 4.5 percent reported in the previous year . However , looking at data running back to 2007 , it is clear that annual increases do not necessarily result in long term growth when it comes to the climb towards proportionate representation in this employment area . In 2008 , eight percent of directors in the U.S. movie industry were female , but in 2013 and 2014 the share dropped to below two percent . The 2019 figure may be the highest recorded since the source began exploring the industry over a decade ago , but history suggests that this will not necessarily translate into future increases , and could drop again in 2020 .
