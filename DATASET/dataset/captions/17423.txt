In Italy , the crude birth rate in 1850 was 38.4 live births per thousand people , meaning that 3.8 percent of the population had been born in that year . Apart from some slight fluctuation in the 1860s , between 1850 and the Second World War , Italy 's crude birth rate decreased very gradually . 38.9 was the highest recorded figure in 1865 , and it decreased to 27.1 in 1930 . Over the next 35 years ( including the Second World War and Italian Civil War ) the birth rate fluctuated , but overall it dropped to 18.6 , and then the decline fell consistently to 10.9 in 1985 , where it then plateaued . In the 2000s , the crude birth rate did increase in the first decade , to 9.7 in 2010 , before dropping again , and it is expected to fall to it 's lowest level of 7.6 in 2020 .
