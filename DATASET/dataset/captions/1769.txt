In 2019 , hip-hop artist Post Malone amassed almost 6.7 billion streams in the United States , outranking Taylor Swift , Billie Eilish , and Ariana Grande . Music streaming is a lucrative source of income for modern musicians and can make up significant portions of their annual income . Second in the ranking was Drake with 6.35 million streams , falling behind slightly after far outperforming all other artists in 2018 with more than ten millions that year . In fact , more than 17 million U.S. dollars of Drake 's 2018 income came from streaming , and singers Beyonc√© and Bruno Mars also made between three and four million dollars each from fans streaming their songs . Equally , whilst newer artists tend to be more successful on streaming platforms than those whose heyday has already passed , many older musicians have adapted to digital formats to increase their online presence and attract new listeners . Elton John earns more from streaming than from sales or publishing , and Paul McCartney also tends to earn over one million dollars per annum by making his music available to stream via digital platforms .
