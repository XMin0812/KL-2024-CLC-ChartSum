Taking full advantage of the perks of the fantasy genre , J.R.R . Tolkien not only invented a whole universe , he also did not adhere to known age structures when he wrote The Lord of The Rings . The ages of his characters differ wildly ; Gollum is almost 600 years old , while Elrond , the elf , is several thousand years old , and Gandalf the Grey – and later the White – is immortal ( for display reasons , both are thus not mentioned here ) .
