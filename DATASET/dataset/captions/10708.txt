Of the ten bloodiest battles of the American Civil War , the Battle of Gettysburg in early July , 1863 , was by far the most devastating battle of the war , claiming over 51 thousand casualties , of which 7 thousand were battle deaths . The Battles of Shiloh , Bull Run ( Second ) , Antietam , Stones River and Chancellorsville all have very similar casualty counts , between 22.5 and 24 thousand casualties each , although it should be noted that the Battle of Antietam took place in a single day , and with 22,717 casualties it is the bloodiest day in US history . The Battles of Chickamauga , the Wilderness and Spotsylvania , all had approximately 30 to 35 thousand casualties each , whereas the Siege of Vicksburg is the only entry on this list with less than 20 thousand casualties .
