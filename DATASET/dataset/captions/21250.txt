The child mortality rate in Spain , for children under the age of five , was 451 deaths per thousand births in 1800 . This means that over 45 percent of all children born in 1800 did not make it to their fifth birthday . Child mortality remained above 300 for most of the nineteenth century , before falling at a much faster rate throughout the 1900s . Despite falling consistently during the last 120 years , there were two occasions where child mortality actually increased , which can be attributed to the Spanish Flu Pandemic in the 1910s and the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s . In 2020 , the child mortality rate in Spain is expected to be just three deaths per thousand births .
