The national minimum wage per month in Spain increased steadily over the last years . The minimum monthly wage grew by almost 60 percent from 2000 to 2020 , with salaries increasing from 600 euros a month to 950 euros a month in 2020 . In 2019 , the Socialist government of Spain passed a decree by which the national minimum wage would be given a boost of 164 euros , therefore making it stand at 900 euros per month as of that year .
