In 2020 , the global semiconductor industry is predicted to grow by 5.1 percent compared to the previous year , a recovery from the 12 percent fall that the market experienced in 2019 . Semiconductors are crucial components of electronics devices . Due to their ability to conduct electricity under some circumstances but not others , they are useful for controlling electrical currents . By adding impurities to a semiconductor , manufacturers are able to customize its conductivity , such as by making it light- or heat-sensitive .
