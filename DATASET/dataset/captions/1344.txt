In 2019 , the number of movie admissions stood at 1.24 billion , the same as was reported two years previously . Thus far the figures reported in 2019 and 2017 are the lowest number in this timeline , however the 2020 number is likely to be substantially lower as a result of movie theater closures due to the coronavirus outbreak . The number of admissions ordinarily depends on a number of factors , but whether not a movie fan visits the cinema often comes down to personal preference and choice . However , when cinemas closed in spring 2020 in an attempt to curb the spread of the coronavirus , choice was no longer a factor . With movie theaters likely to be out of action for a significant portion of 2020 , admissions numbers are set to plummet , along with ticket sales and box office revenue .
