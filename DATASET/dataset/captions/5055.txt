During the eighteenth century , it is estimated that France 's population grew by roughly fifty percent , from 19.7 million in 1700 , to 29 million by 1800 . In France itself , the 1700s are remembered for the end of King Louis XIV 's reign in 1715 , the Age of Enlightenment , and the French Revolution . During this century , the scientific and ideological advances made in France and across Europe challenged the leadership structures of the time , and questioned the relationship between monarchial , religious and political institutions and their subjects . France was arguably the most powerful nation in the world in these early years , with the second largest population in Europe ( after Russia ) ; however , this century was defined by a number of costly , large-scale conflicts across Europe and in the new North American theater , which saw the loss of most overseas territories ( particularly in North America ) and almost bankrupted the French crown . A combination of regressive taxation , food shortages and enlightenment ideologies ultimately culminated in the French Revolution in 1789 , which brought an end to the Ancien RÃ©gime , and set in motion a period of self-actualization .
