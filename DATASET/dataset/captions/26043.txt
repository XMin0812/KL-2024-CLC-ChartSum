This graph shows the total length of railroad tracks in each of the home fronts in 1861 , at the outbreak of the American Civil War . From the data we can see that the Union States had over double the amount of railroad than the Confederacy , and well over ten time that of the Border states . This is was a significant advantage for the Union forces as they had a much better infrastructure for transporting men and supplies throughout the war .
