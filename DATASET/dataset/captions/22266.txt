Although its popularity has experienced some decline , many Spaniards regularly practice cycling for transport , recreation , or sport purposes . Regrettably , some bike rides might have an unfortunate turn of events and end up in accidents where the cyclists involved were unable to pull through . This is the case for the 58 cyclists that were victims of fatal traffic accidents in Spain in 2018 . This figure has been fluctuating over the past years , with its lowest point in 2011 at 49 fatalities and peaking at 78 deaths in 2017 .
