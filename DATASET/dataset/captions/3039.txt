The Act of Union 1707 brought the present-day states of England and Wales together with Scotland , and formed the United Kingdom of Great Britain . Since this time there have been twelve Heads of State , from three different families . The first of these was Queen Anne , of the House of Stuart , who ruled for a total of 7 years and 92 days , from 1707 to 1714 ( although she had been the Queen of England since 1702 ) .
