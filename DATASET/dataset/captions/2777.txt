As of 23rd January 2020 , Luigi Riva is the all time leader in goals scored for the international football team of Italy with a total of 35 goals scored , followed rather closely by Giuseppe Meazza with 33 goals . Meazza has passed away back in 1979 and Riva retired from the national already back in 1974 so these records are exceptionally old .
