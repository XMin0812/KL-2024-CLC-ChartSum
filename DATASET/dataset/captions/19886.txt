Life expectancy in Norway was 35 years in 1765 , and over the course of the next 255 years , it is expected to have increased to 82.2 years by 2020 . Although life expectancy has generally increased throughout history , there were several times where the rate deviated from its previous trajectory . These changes were a result of famine and influenza epidemics between 1765 and 1865 , and again in the 1910s because of the Spanish Flu epidemic that spread across Europe .
