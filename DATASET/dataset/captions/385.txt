How much did a Super Bowl ad cost in 2020 ? That year advertisers had to pay 5.6 million U.S. dollars to air a 30-second long commercial during the Super Bowl LIV broadcast . The Super Bowl is one of the biggest events on the sporting calendar , but it is so much more than just the football being played on the pitch . The spectacle surrounding the event , which culminates in the legendary half-time show , is hotly anticipated and watched by millions around the world . With so many captive viewers before , during , and after the game , advertisers use the Super Bowl as a means of raising awareness for their products . However , this awareness and visibility comes at a cost â€“ since 2016 the average price of a 30-second TV advertisement during Super Bowl stood at around five million U.S. dollars and has risen even further in the last two years .
