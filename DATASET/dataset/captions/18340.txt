Over the course of the long nineteenth century , Estonia 's population almost tripled , from 0.33 million in 1800 , to over one million at the outbreak of the First World War . Throughout this time , Estonia was a part of the Russian Empire , however Germany then annexed the region during the First World War ; when the German army eventually retreated in 1918 , Estonian forces prevented Russia from re-taking the area in the Estonian War of Independence , and an independent Estonian Republic was gradually established between 1918 and 1920 . Relative to its size and population , Estonia developed into a prosperous and peaceful nation in the interwar period , and Estonian language and culture thrived , although political stability proved difficult for the Baltic state .
