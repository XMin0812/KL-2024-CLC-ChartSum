Per capita carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) emissions in the United States reached an estimate of 15.5 metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2019 . The United States has forecast that a decrease in CO2 emissions will occur through 2050 , reaching 12.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per person . This forecast is driven by increasing consumption of natural gas due to lower cost and emissions with higher efficiency . Increased use of natural gas is expected to parallel the decline of coal , which has higher emissions and lower efficiency .
