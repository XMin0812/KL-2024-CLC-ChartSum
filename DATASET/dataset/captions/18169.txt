Belgium 's federal prisons have been struggling with overpopulation in recent years . In 2019 , the prison population in Belgium amounted to 10,883 prisoners and detainees . Whilst most inmates were men , there were 483 female detainees registered in Belgian prisons in 2019 . During that year , 13 children were calculated in the registers of Belgian prisons . Although no information on these children is provided , in the interest of the child some babies sleep in prison with their mothers , which could possibly explain these figures .
