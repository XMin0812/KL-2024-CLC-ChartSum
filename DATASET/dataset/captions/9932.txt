Tuscany 's water bills were the highest in Italy : in 2019 , the average household spent 688 euros on water bills . Other two central regions ranked in the top three most expensive regions : Umbria and Marche . This macro-region was the one with the highest investments by water management companies for the period 2016 to 2019 . In contrast , water bills were much cheaper in regions where private sector investments in water infrastructure were low , such as the Southern regions of Calabria and Molise .
