The overall CD ratio of private sector banks in the country stood at around 88 percent that year . The credit to deposit ratio is an important first indication to gauge a bank 's health , as it shows how much of a bank 's core funds are being used for lending . A very high ratio indicates pressure on resources as well as capital adequacy issues , while a very low ratio can mean that the bank is not using its available resources optimally .
