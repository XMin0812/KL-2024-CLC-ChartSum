The fertility rate of a country is the average number of children that women from that country will have throughout their reproductive years . Between 1840 and 1855 the fertility rate of the Netherlands fell from 5.1 to 4.7 , before rising again to 5.4 . This is the highest ever recorded rate of fertility in the Netherlands , as after this the number dropped gradually until 1940 , where it was just 2.6 children per woman . From the early 1940s ( which was slightly earlier than most other Western European countries ) until the late 1960s , the Netherlands experienced its 'baby boom ' _ , before the fertility rate dropped to 1.5 in 1985 . Since 1985 , the fertility rate has remained relatively constant , staying between 1.5 and 1.8 children per woman in this 35 year period .
