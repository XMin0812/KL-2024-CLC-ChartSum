Life expectancy in Japan was 36.4 in the year 1860 , and over the course of the next 160 years , it is expected to have increased to 84.4 , which is the second highest in the world ( after Monaco ) . Although life expectancy has generally increased throughout Japan 's history , there were several times where the rate deviated from its previous trajectory . These changes were a result of the Spanish Flu in the 1910s , the Second World War in the 1940s , and the sharp increase was due to the high rate of industrialization and economic prosperity in Japan , in the mid-twentieth century .
