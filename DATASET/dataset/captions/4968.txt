The child mortality rate in India , for children under the age of five , was 509 deaths per thousand births in 1880 . This means that over half of all children born in 1880 did not survive past the age of five , and it remained this way until the twentieth century . From 1900 until today , the child mortality rate has fallen from over 53 percent in 1900 , to under four percent in 2020 . Since 1900 , there were only two times where the child mortality rate increased in India , which were as a result of the Spanish Flu pandemic in the 1910s , and in the 1950s as India adjusted to its newfound independence .
