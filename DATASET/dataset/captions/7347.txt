In 1500 , the largest city was Paris , with an estimated 225 thousand inhabitants , almost double the population of the second-largest city , Naples . As in 1330 , Venice and Milan remain the third and fourth largest cities in Western Europe , however Genoa 's population almost halved from 1330 until 1500 , as it was struck heavily by the bubonic plague in the mid-1300s . In lists prior to this , the largest cities were generally in Spain and Italy , however , as time progressed , the largest populations could be found more often in Italy and France . The year 1500 is around the beginning of what we now consider modern history , a time that saw the birth of many European empires and inter-continental globalization .
