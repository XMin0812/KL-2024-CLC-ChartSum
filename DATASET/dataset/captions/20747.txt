In the first quarter of 2020 , the Netherlands were not in debt , leading to a NIIP value of 99 percent of GDP . The net international investment position ( NIIP ) is the value of financial assets of Dutch residents abroad minus the value of financial assets of non-residents in the Netherlands and is calculated as a percentage of GDP . Financial investors use this indicator to gauge the creditworthiness of a country . If the NIIP is negative , a country is in debt to the rest of the world . A large negative net international investment position means that a country is sensitive to developments on international capital markets and effectively is a debtor nation . A positive NIIP value indicates a nation is a creditor nation . For this indicator the European Commission has only set a lower limit of -35 percent .
