The World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimates that there were millions of smallpox cases every year until the 1970s , when the WHO 's eradication program then successfully eliminated the disease in nature . Some academic estimates place smallpox 's death toll at 300 million in the twentieth century , and 500 million in its final hundred years of existence . The development of the smallpox vaccination , which was the first successfully developed vaccine ( the word vaccination comes from the Latin word for cow ; '' vacca '' , as cowpox was used to develop the smallpox vaccine ) , greatly contributed to the significant decline in infant and child mortality across the globe , and the boom in population growth during the twentieth century .
