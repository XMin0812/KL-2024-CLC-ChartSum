Albania , then known as Rumelia , was a province of the Ottoman Empire from the fifteenth century until it declared it 's independence in 1912 . Following a series of unsuccessful uprisings and brief occupations from nearby Serbia and Greece , Albania finally claimed its independence on November 28 , 1912 ; however the Conference of London in 1913 then set the borders of the former-Ottoman states in Southern Europe , which left many ethnic Albanians living in other neighboring states , particularly Serbia ( and what is now Kosovo ) . The newly-formed Albanian state collapsed in the wake of the First World War , and was controlled in parts by Greece , Italy and Serbia . The Paris Conference then established an independent Albanian state , which led to a period of political and economic turmoil that lasted until Italy 's annexation of the region in 1939 , during the Second World War . It is estimated that just under 3 percent of Albania 's population perished as a direct result of the war , as Albania became the main theater for the Axis Powers ' war against Greece . Italy then surrendered control of the area to Germany in 1943 , and after the war ended in 1945 , Albania became a Yugoslav satellite state and remained behind the Iron Curtain until it 's collapse in the 1990s .
