The infant mortality rate in Australia , for children under the age of one year old , was 111 deaths per thousand births in 1870 . This means that for all babies born in 1870 , over eleven percent did not survive past their first birthday . Over the course of the next 150 years , this number has dropped significantly , reaching its lowest point ever in 2020 to three deaths per thousand births .
