This statistic shows the results of a consumer survey conducted by Packaged Facts in August 2012 . People were asked if they suffer from celiac disease or wheat/gluten intolerance and if they buy gluten-free products . The results indicated that only 0.1 percent of the U.S. population are diagnosed celiacs , whereas 18 percent of the consumers actually buy products tagged as gluten-free . Hence , there was a large gap between the number of people who really need to stick to a gluten-free diet and those who actually buy gluten-free products .
