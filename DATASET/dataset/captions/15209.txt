Life expectancy in Spain was below thirty in the year 1880 , and over the course of the next 140 years , it is expected to have increased to 83.4 by the year 2020 . Although life expectancy has generally increased throughout Spain 's history , there were several times where the rate deviated from its previous trajectory . The most notable changes were a result of the global influenza epidemic of the 1910s , ( called the 'Spanish Flu ' as it received more press coverage in neutral Spain , during the First World War ) and the Spanish Civil War two decades later .
