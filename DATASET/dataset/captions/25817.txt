Among those surveyed , 29.4 percent expect that they or their family will reduce their spending on premium brands as a result of the decision to leave the EU . However , the largest proportion of respondents ( 30.7 percent ) think that they will spend the same post-Brexit and 18.9 percent will spend more .
