Chile is one of the few Latin American countries whose monetary policy rates have stayed relatively low in the past decade . Monetary policy rate , also known as base interest rate or base rate , is a percentage defined by central banks to determine the cost of credit in a given economy . This indicator serves as a guide for other financial institutions to set their own interest rates . In 2018 , the Central Bank of Chile set the monetary policy rate at 2.56 percent in 2018 , slightly down from 2.67 percent a year earlier .
