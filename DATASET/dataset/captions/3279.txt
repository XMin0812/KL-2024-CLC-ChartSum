Some people complain that these days couples are not willing to invest in their relationship anymore , that the first hurdle encountered is a reason for a separation , and that â€˜ till death do us part ' does not really mean anything anymore . But whether that is true or not , facts show that people in the Netherlands continuously wait longer to file for a divorce . In the last decade , the average duration of marriage at the time of a divorce has increased by nearly a year , from 14.2 years in 2008 to 15 in 2018 . In the 1950s , this was even shorter . In 1950 , the average divorced couple had been married for 11.2 years before divorcing .
