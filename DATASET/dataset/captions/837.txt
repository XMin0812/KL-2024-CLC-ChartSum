Gross domestic product is soaring , and despite the densely populated country being among the smallest in the Asia Pacific region , its GDP per capita is not â€“ it has almost doubled over the past decade . Sri Lanka 's inflation rate has been through the wringer , however : From around seven percent in 2013 to a sudden slump to around two percent in 2015 with a rapid upturn and peak at 6.5 percent in 2017 again , it is expected to stabilize around the 4.7 percent-mark over the next few years . The slump in 2015 is mainly due to the country amassing national debt , which is soaring just as much as GDP . Sri Lanka has been spending so much money on developing its infrastructure , it needed help from the International Monetary Fund .
