Brussels was the home of five Bitcoin ATMs as of June 2020 , whereas Amsterdam had more than 20 of these cryptocurrency installations . In general , Bitcoin ATMs were to be found in the bigger cities of the two cities , but they also sporadically appeared in smaller cities . No recent data exists on the market size of Bitcoin in either Belgium or the Netherlands . In the first three quarters of 2017 , there were approximately 44,000 transactions in Bitcoin from the Netherlands on a domestic trading platform called BTC Direct . This lack of market data has two reasons . First , the design of the digital currency ( meant to provide privacy ) makes it is difficult to trace . Second , Bitcoin did not reach the news in the two countries that often after 2017 . Approximately 60 percent of the households in the Netherlands who invested in cryptocurrencies started doing so in that year . Data on cryptocurrencies in Belgium and the Netherlands therefore mostly stems from 2017 and 2018 , not from 2019 .
