Edward Jenner 's work on smallpox , published in 1797 , was the first time that any scientific findings about vaccination were presented to the wider medical community . Within a few short years of this publication , vaccination had been practiced in most European countries , and the impact was beginning to show almost immediately ; particularly in countries such as Sweden and England . As vaccination practices spread , the severity and frequency of smallpox pandemics declined , and the disease ceased to be endemic in some regions .
