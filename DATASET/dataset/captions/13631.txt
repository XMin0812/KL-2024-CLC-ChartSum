The child mortality rate in Germany , for children under the age of five , was 340 deaths per thousand births in 1800 . This means that more than one in every three children born in 1800 did not make it to their fifth birthday . Child mortality increased to almost fifty percent in the mid-nineteenth century , as the country industrialized and urbanized rapidly , which allowed diseases to spread much faster . This changed however , with the introduction of mandatory vaccination in 1874 , which kickstarted a gradual decline in child mortality in Germany . The decline was most rapid in the first half of the twentieth century , and by the year 2020 child mortality in Germany is expected to be as low as four deaths per thousand births .
