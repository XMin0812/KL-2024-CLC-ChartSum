In the 37 canonized plays in William Shakespeare 's body of work , the number of speeches in each play ranges from 605 to 1,361 separate speech entries . These speeches are when characters speak , ( which can be entire soliloquies , or simple one-word answers ) as well as narrations and stage directions . The plays with the most separate speech entries are Antony and Cleopatra , Othello and Triolus and Cressida , all of which have over 1.3 thousand speeches . Although Hamlet is the Shakespeare play with the highest word-count , it has only the fourth highest number of speeches ( Hamlet is also famous for its numerous soliloquies , such as `` To be or not to be '' ) . There are three Shakespeare plays with fewer than 650 separate speech entries , which are Richard II , King John and A Midsummer Night 's Dream . The Comedy of Errors , which has the lowest word count of any Shakespeare play , has only the fifth fewest speech entries .
