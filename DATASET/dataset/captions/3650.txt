The Treaty of Versailles reduced Germany 's territory in Europe by approximately 13 percent , and stripped Germany of all its overseas territories and colonies . If a map of these territories is transposed on to a modern map of the world , we can see that these territories are situated in 28 modern countries . In Europe , all of this land was given to neighboring states ( including Lithuania , which bordered German East Prussia at the time ) , with the largest areas of land being annexed by France and Poland . The Treaty of Versailles also established the Free City of Danzig ( modern-day Gda≈Ñsk , Poland ) as a semi-autonomous city-state under League of Nations protection .
