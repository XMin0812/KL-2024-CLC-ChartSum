In the last decade , the average age of the Dutch population increased year on year . Whereas the population had an average age of nearly 40 years in 2009 , ten years later the average age reached 42 years . As a result , in this period the grey population pressure ( the ratio of the non-working population compared to the working population ) increased as well , by over eight percentage points .
