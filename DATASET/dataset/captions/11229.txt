As of April 2020 , in response to the global pandemic crisis caused by the novel coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) , 30 states within the United States have defined construction activities as essential , while a total of 45 declared orders limiting work activities . In New York , Governor Cuomo clarified that `` all non-essential construction must shut down except for emergency construction '' . Emergency construction in this case includes projects that would protect the health and safety of occupants or a project that would be unsafe if it remained unfinished .
