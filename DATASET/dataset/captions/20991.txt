This graph shows Denmark 's total population from the year 1769 until 2020 . Generally speaking , Denmark 's population has been growing at a rather steady rate for the past 250 years . The numbers begin in 1769 where Denmark 's population was approximately 798 thousand ; it then grows at a consistent rate for the next 210 years , before the population decreases slightly in the 1980s . This dip in population is attributed to a decrease in the fertility rate across Europe during this time , resulting from improvements and increased access to contraception . The population then begins growing again in the late 1980s , due to a positive net migration rate and ageing population ; today , the population is just under 5.8 million people .
