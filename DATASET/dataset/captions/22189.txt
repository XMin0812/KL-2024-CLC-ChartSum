France 's largest forested area is not in Europe but in South America . It is indeed in the overseas department that we find the largest French forest in Guyane , the Amazon jungle with more than 8 million hectares . Across the entire metropolitan area , forests represented approximately 17 million hectares in 2019 . Nouvelle-Aquitaine was the region where the largest forest cover in France was found , with nearly 3 million hectares of forest . The overseas islands and departments were , in view of their small surface area , the regions with the least forest area . However , in terms of size , the Pays de la Loire region is the least forested area in France , with less than 500,000 hectares of forest .
