When converted to the value of one Euro in 2020 , goods and services that cost one Euro in the year 2000 would cost approximately 1.39 Euros today , meaning that goods and services in the Eurozone are 39 % more expensive today than they were twenty years ago . This data can be used to calculate how much goods and services from the years shown would cost today , by multiplying the price from then by the number shown in the graph . For example , an item that cost 50 Euros in 2010 would theoretically cost 56.5 Euros in 2020 's money ( i.e . 50 x 1.13 = 56.5 ) .
