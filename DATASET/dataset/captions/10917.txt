COVID-19 redirected consumer intentions in the mobility sector . The effects are different across countries . In Germany and the United States , a slight drop in car purchase intentions as of August 2020 was recorded . In China , however , the change in consumers intending to purchase a new vehicle post-COVID rather than pre-COVID went up by seven percent . It is likely that the pandemic has put some people off public transport and are attracted to the personal space of an owned vehicle . Consumers who are now less likely to buy a new car may be put off for financial reasons . During national lockdowns in 2020 , vehicle purchase plummeted . Economic standstill and lay-offs kept car sales low for the year overall .
