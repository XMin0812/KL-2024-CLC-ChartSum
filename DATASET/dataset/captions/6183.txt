Life expectancy in China was just 32 in the year 1850 , and over the course of the next 170 years , it is expected to more than double to 76.6 years in 2020 . Between 1850 and 1950 , finding reliable data proved difficult for anthropologists , however some events , such as the Taiping Rebellion and Dungan Revolt in the nineteenth century did reduce life expectancy by a few years , and also the Chinese Civil War and Second World War in the first half of the twentieth century . In the second half of the 1900s , Chinese life expectancy increased greatly , as the country became more industrialized and the standard of living increased .
