In fiscal year 2019 , the value of the net non-performing assets of private banks across India amounted to over 674 billion Indian rupees . This was evidently much lesser in fiscal year 2017 , amounting to about 490 billion rupees .

Since more banks are facing a problem of risky or non-paying assets , the profitability and solvency of the banks has gone down , in turn adversely affecting the economy of the nation .
