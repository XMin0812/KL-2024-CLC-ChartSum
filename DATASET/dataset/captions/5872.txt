Buying and selling items online has become rather common over the last decade , as the latest studies can confirm . Spain is no exception to this trend , with its population gradually getting more comfortable with paying for products online . According to the latest figures , half of the Spaniards preferred to pay for their online purchases through their debit or credit card , whereas slightly over 40 percent were more inclined to use online payment systems such as PayPal as their payment method of choice . In contrast , only three percent of the population paid with cash upon delivery .
