Coyhaique , a city in southern Chile with a population of a little over 50 thousand inhabitants , was the most polluted city in Latin America in 2019 , based on fine air particulate matter concentration ( PM2.5 ) . That year , the city reported an average PM2.5 concentration of 41.5 micrograms per cubic meter . In addition to industrial and transport air pollution , this result is the consequence of a cultural and geographical mixture very common in Chile , where pollution generated from burning wood for heating and cooking gets trapped by the mountains surrounding Chile 's extensive valleys .
