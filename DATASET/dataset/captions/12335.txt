The coronavirus outbreak has drastically changed many aspects of society 's every day life , including the way we work . Spain , severely affected by the pandemic , had to transform the way its workforce operated to curb the spread of the coronavirus just like many other countries in the world .

Some 18 percent of respondents were placed under ERTE regulations , by which they were temporarily laid off and had access to unemployment benefits paid by the Spanish Government .
