From 1273 until 1918 , Austria was the seat of power of the House of Habsburg ; one of Europe 's most powerful and influential royal families of the past millennium . During this time and in the subsequent century since the Austro-Hungarian Empire 's dissolution , the borders and demography of the Austrian state have changed dramatically , with the population growing from approximately three million people in 1800 to just over nine million in 2020 . The area of modern Austria 's population rose gradually throughout the nineteenth century , until the early 1900s , where it then dropped and fluctuated during the World Wars , before rising again until recent years .
