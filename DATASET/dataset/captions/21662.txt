The child mortality rate in Norway , for children under the age of five , was 336 deaths per thousand births in 1815 . This means that approximately 34 percent of all children born in 1815 did not make it to their fifth birthday . Over the course of the next 205 years , this number has dropped drastically , particularly from 1865 onwards , and the rate has dropped to its lowest point ever in 2020 where it is just two deaths per thousand births , which is the lowest in the world . The only times where Norway 's child mortality rate increased in the twentieth century was in the 1910s and 1940s , as a result of the Spanish Flu pandemic and the Second World War .
