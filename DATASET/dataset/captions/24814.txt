The Third Plague Pandemic began in the 1850s in the Yunnan region of China . While the plague became endemic to Yunnan over the next few decades , it was not until 1894 that it reached epidemic levels in Hong Kong , taking almost 2,500 lives in that year , and seeing the evacuation of almost one third of Hong Kong 's inhabitants . From 1894 to 1902 , the disease was continuously re-introduced to the city through maritime trade , with varying fatality rates , however it would take almost ten thousand lives in the city over these years .
