Based on an `` illustrative scenario '' in which the United Kingdom ( UK ) moves to a comprehensive free trade agreement with the European Union ( EU ) on the 1st of January 2021 , this forecast shows the expected annual average bank base interest rate in response to the current Covid-19 pandemic . In a bid to minimize the economic effects of the Covid-19 virus , on the 19th of March 2020 the Bank of England cut the official bank base rate to a record low of 0.1 percent . This historic low came just one week after the Bank of England cut rates from 0.75 percent to 0.25 percent in a bid to prevent mass job cuts in the United Kingdom . In the current forecast scenario , bank interest rates are set to stay between 0.1 percent and 0.2 percent up to 2022 .
