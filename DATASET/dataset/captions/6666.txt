The average price paid when a Dutch private individual bought existing residential property in 2019 was about 308,000 euros . In recent years , the housing market has continued to rise in the Netherlands due to low mortgage rates , a recovering economy and a high level of consumer confidence . For example , the number of registered transactions reached a value of approximately 215,000 in 2016 and the average selling price of houses was higher than in 2013 , when prices reached a low point . In 2018 , real estate transactions are expected to decrease with six percent as a high number of sales , combined with an increasingly scarce supply , are expected to push the housing price up .
