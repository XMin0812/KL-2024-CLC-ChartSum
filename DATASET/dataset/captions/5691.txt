The problem of unemployment in Italy became critical in the first years of the financial crisis which started in 2008 . Although the labor market crisis seriously affected the entire Italian working population , it particularly impacted the youngest part of the labor force . Between 2008 and 2014 alone , the share of unemployed individuals aged between 15 and 24 years increased by more than 15 percent . Despite a steady decline observed after 2014 , youth unemployment still stood at over 31 percent in July 2020 .
