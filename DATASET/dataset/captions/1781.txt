The statistic shows the most used instant messaging services on mobile phones in the United Kingdom ( UK ) in 2013 . In 2013 , 50 percent of the respondents used Whatsapp most on their mobile phone . The second most common result is Facebook Messenger ( 42 percent ) . WhatsApp is a well established instant messaging service mostly used by mobile phone owners between the age of 18 and 29 . However , all age groups are utilizing this messaging service at some level . Snapchat is definitely less popular than WhatsApp as can be seen in this statistic . However , still more than half of all 18 to 29 year olds are using Snapchat in the UK . Mobile messaging retail revenue of operators has seen a steady continuous decrease from 2010 to 2015 . This is in direct correlation with the rising use of instant messaging services that run through the internet instead of through the mobile network operators .
