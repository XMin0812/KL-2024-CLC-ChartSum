In the end of December 2020 , the yield for a two-year U.S. Treasury bond was 0.13 percent , higher than the one month yield of 0.08 percent . Bonds of longer maturities generally have higher yields as a reward for the uncertainty about the condition of financial markets in the future . However , the yield curve inverted in March 2019 when long-term bonds had lower yields than short-term bonds , which has historically occurred before each of the last five U.S. recessions . This trend continued until the Federal Reserve cut interest rates several times throughout 2019 .
