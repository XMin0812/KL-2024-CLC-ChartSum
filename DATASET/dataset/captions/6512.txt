In December 2019 , over a quarter of UK smartphone users aged between 18 and 24 were using TikTok . The video-sharing social media app has become hugely popular with `` Generation Z '' since its launch in September 2017 . TikTok is also slightly more popular with the female demographic than it is with male smartphone users . In contrast , only 9.3 percent of 25 to 34 year-olds used the app , and overall the share of users was much lower among older age groups .
