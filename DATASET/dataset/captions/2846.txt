The price of solar photovoltaic modules in the United States has seen a fairly consistent decrease over the last few years . In Q2 2020 , U.S. multi module prices averaged 0.19 U.S. dollars per watt , in comparison to 0.63 U.S. dollars per watt in Q1 2016 . Solar system pricing has fallen in all markets , including residential , non-residential , and utility markets . The decline is largely due to declining hardware costs , primarily from lower module prices . The oversupply of modules due to decreasing demand from China lowered module prices ; in turn , this has helped to alleviate the tariffs that were implemented on Chinese module exports to the United States .
