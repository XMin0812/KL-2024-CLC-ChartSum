When converted to the value of one US dollar in 2020 , goods and services that cost one dollar in 1700 would cost just over 63 dollars in 2020 , this means that one dollar in 1700 was worth approximately 63 times more than it is today . This data can be used to calculate how much goods and services from the years shown would cost today , by multiplying the price from then by the number shown in the graph . For example , an item that cost 50 dollars in 1970 would theoretically cost 335.5 US dollars in 2020 ( 50 x 6.71 = 335.5 ) , although it is important to remember that the prices of individual goods and services inflate at different rates than currency , therefore this graph must only be used as a guide .
