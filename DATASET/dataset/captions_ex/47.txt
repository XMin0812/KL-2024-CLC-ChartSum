After entering Italy , the coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) spread fast during March and April 2020 . The strict lockdown implemented by the government helped slowing down the contagion .. However , since August the number of infections started to rise again dramatically . For this reason , in November the government assigned to each region a level of risk , corresponding to three colors : yellow , orange , and red . Different restrictions correspond to each level , with red regions implementing a lockdown alike to the one imposed on the whole country in the Spring . As of January 5 , 2021 , the total number of cases reported by the authorities surpassed 2.1 million . The north of the country was mostly hit , and the region with the highest number of cases was Lombardy , which registered 487,271 of them . The neighboring regions of Veneto and Piedmont followed in the list . When adjusting these figures for the population size of each region , however , the picture changed considerably , with Aosta Valley being the area where the virus had the highest relative incidence .
