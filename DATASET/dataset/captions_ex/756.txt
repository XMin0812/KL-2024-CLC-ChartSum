Nigeria 's inflation has been higher than the average for African and Sub-Saharan countries for years now , and even exceeded 16 percent in 2017 – and a real , significant decrease is nowhere in sight . The bigger problem is its unsteadiness , however : An inflation rate that is bouncing all over the place , like this one , is usually a sign of a struggling economy , causing prices to fluctuate , and unemployment and poverty to increase . Nigeria 's economy - a so-called `` mixed economy '' , which means the market economy is at least in part regulated by the state – is not entirely in bad shape , though . More than half of its GDP is generated by the services sector , namely telecommunications and finances , and the country derives a significant share of its state revenues from oil .
