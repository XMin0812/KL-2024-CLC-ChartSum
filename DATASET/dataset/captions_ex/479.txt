In this period , Greece had the highest proportion of smokers in the EU with 37 percent . Cigarette prices differ across Europe : the most expensive country in which to purchase cigarettes is the United Kingdom ( UK ) . Cigarette prices in Europe are driven by the respective taxes imposed within each of the member states and consist of a specific duty per 1,000 cigarettes and an ad valorem rate onto the recommended retail price , in addition to value added tax ( VAT ) . Thus the highest rates of taxation are reflected in the retail prices . Similar rates of taxation between countries are also found for hand rolling tobacco , where the highest levels of taxation are found in the United Kingdom once again . Governments that impose such strong barriers to the purchasing of tobacco are considered 'nanny states ' _ , with high levels of control on other factors , such as advertising , bans of tobacco products on retail displays and graphic warnings on cigarette packs .
