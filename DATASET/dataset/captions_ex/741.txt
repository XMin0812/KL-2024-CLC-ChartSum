The rate of civilians killed by police in the United States is far higher than in comparable developed democratic countries , with 33.5 people killed by police per 10 million residents in 2019 . This compares 9.8 deaths per 10 million residents in Canada , and 8.5 in Australia - perhaps the two most comparable countries to the United States in many respects .
